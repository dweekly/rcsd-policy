# Compliance Checker V2 - Improvements

## Key Changes from V1 to V2

### 1. **Unified Policy/Regulation Analysis**
- V1: Analyzed BPs and ARs separately, leading to false positives
- V2: Analyzes BP and AR together as a unified policy group

### 2. **Clear Document Type Identification**
- V1: Results didn't clearly indicate if finding was for BP or AR
- V2: Each finding shows which document(s) are missing the requirement:
  - `missing_from: BP` - Only the Board Policy is missing it
  - `missing_from: AR` - Only the Administrative Regulation is missing it  
  - `missing_from: BOTH` - Missing from both (true material issue)

### 3. **Reduced False Positives**
- V1: Flagged ARs for missing content that was appropriately in the BP
- V2: Only flags as MATERIAL if missing from BOTH documents

### 4. **Better Compliance Understanding**
- V1: Didn't recognize the BP/AR division of responsibilities
- V2: Understands that:
  - BPs contain board direction, rights, and notifications
  - ARs contain implementation procedures
  - Requirements can be appropriately split between them

## Example: Policy 6142.1 (Sexual Health Education)

### V1 Analysis Issues:
- Flagged AR 6142.1 for "Missing Parent/Guardian Notification Requirements"
- These requirements were actually present in BP 6142.1
- Created confusion by reporting the same policy number twice with different issues

### V2 Analysis Improvements:
- Analyzes BP 6142.1 and AR 6142.1 together
- Recognizes parent notification is in the BP (appropriate placement)
- Only flags truly missing requirements from both documents
- Provides clearer reporting: "BP 6142.1 - Sexual Health Education"

## Running V2

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
cd /Users/dew/dev/rcsd-policy && source venv/bin/activate

# Run full analysis (will take several hours)
python scripts/compliance_checker_v2.py

# Test on a single policy group
python scripts/compliance_checker_v2.py --code 6142.1

# Results will be in data/analysis/compliance_v2/
```

## Output Structure

V2 creates cleaner output:
- Material issues only include requirements missing from BOTH documents
- Executive summary clearly shows document type (BP/AR)
- JSON data includes both policy and regulation information
- Recommendations include which document should contain the requirement
