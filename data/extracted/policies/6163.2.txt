The Board of Education recognizes that animals can be an effective teaching aid. In addition, instruction related to
the care and treatment of animals teaches students a sense of responsibility and promotes the humane treatment of
living creatures.
Animals may be brought to school for educational purposes, subject to rules and precautions specified in
administrative regulations related to health, safety and sanitation. Teachers shall ensure that these rules and
precautions are observed so as to protect both the students and animals.
Seeing-eye dogs and service dogs may accompany students and staff at school as needed.
The district assumes no liability for the safety of animals voluntarily brought to school.
