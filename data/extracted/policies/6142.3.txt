================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that citizen involvement in civic and political institutions is essential to a
democratic government and desires to provide a comprehensive civic education program to help students acquire
the knowledge, skills, and principles essential for informed, responsible citizenship.
The Board shall approve, upon the recommendation of the Superintendent or designee, academic standards and
curriculum in civics and government that are aligned with state academic standards and curriculum frameworks as
budget permits.
The Superintendent or designee shall determine specific courses within the K-8 curriculum in which civic education
and government may be explicitly and systematically taught. He/she also shall encourage the integration of civic
education into other subjects as appropriate.
The district's civic education program shall provide students with an understanding of the rights and responsibilities
of citizens in American democracy and the workings of federal, state, and local governments. As appropriate,
instruction should include an examination of fundamental American documents, including, but not limited to, the
Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, the Federalist Papers, and other significant writings
and speeches.
To develop a sense of political effectiveness, instruction should develop students' understanding of the importance
of civic participation in a democratic society. Service learning, extracurricular and cocurricular activities, class and
school elections, and observation of local government processes may be used to reinforce classroom instruction by
linking civic knowledge to practical experience and encouraging civic involvement.
Instruction also should promote a student's understanding of shared democratic principles and values, such as
personal responsibility, justice, equality, respect for others, civic-mindedness, and patriotism, and enable students to
make their own commitment to these civic values.
Constitution/Citizenship Day
Each year on or near September 17, in commemoration of Constitution and Citizenship Day, the district may hold an
educational program for students in grades K-8 pertaining to the United States Constitution which shall include
exercises and instruction in the purpose, meaning, and importance of the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights.
