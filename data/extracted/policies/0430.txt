The Governing Board recognizes its obligation to provide a free appropriate public education to all
individuals with disabilities, aged 3 to 21 years, who reside in the district.
In order to meet the needs of individuals with disabilities, the district shall participate as a member of a
Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) with other districts and the county office of education pursuant to
Education Code 56195.1.
The district shall enter into agreements with other members of the SELPA in accordance with Education
Code 56195.1 and 56195.7. Consistent with these agreements, the district shall adopt policies governing the
programs and services it operates. (Education Code 56195.8)
The Superintendent or designee shall work with the other members of the SELPA to develop a local plan for
the education of individuals with disabilities. The plan shall be approved by the Board and the other
members of the SELPA, and shall be submitted to the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (Education Code
56195.1)
The local plan shall be reviewed at least once every three years and updated as needed to ensure the
information contained in the plan remains relevant and accurate. The local plan shall be updated
cooperatively by a committee of representatives of special and regular education teachers and administrators
selected by the groups they represent and with participation by parent/guardian members of the community
advisory committee, or parents/guardians selected by the community advisory committee, to ensure
adequate and effective participation and communication. (Education Code 56195.9)
Special education programs and services shall be reviewed on an ongoing basis. The results of such
evaluations shall be used to identify and correct any program deficiencies.
