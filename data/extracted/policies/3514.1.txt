The Board of Education recognizes that potentially hazardous substances are used in the daily operations of our
schools. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure these substances are inventoried, used, stored and regularly
disposed of in a safe and legal manner.
Insofar as possible, the Superintendent or designee shall minimize the quantities of hazardous substances stored on
school property and shall substitute less dangerous materials for hazardous substances.
Hazard Communication Program
The Superintendent or designee shall develop, implement and monitor a written hazard communication program in
accordance with state law. As part of this program, he/she shall ensure that employees are fully informed about the
properties and potential hazards of substances to which they may be exposed and that material safety data sheets
are readily accessible to them.
Teachers shall instruct students about the importance of proper handling, storage, disposal and protection when
using any potentially hazardous substance.
