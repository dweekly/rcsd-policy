================================================================================

The Board of Education desires to maintain the highest ethical standards and help ensure that decisions are made in
the best interest of the district and the public. Accordingly, no Board member, district employee, or other person in a
designated position shall participate in the making of any decision for the district when the decision will or may be
affected by their financial, family, or other personal interest or consideration.
Even if a prohibited conflict of interest does not exist, a Board member shall abstain from voting on personnel
matters that uniquely affect their relatives. However, a Board member may vote on collective bargaining agreements
and personnel matters that affect a class of employees to which their relative belongs. Relative means an adult who
is related to the Board member by blood or affinity within the third degree, as determined by the common law, or an
individual in an adoptive relationship within the third degree. (Education Code 35107)
A relationship within the third degree includes an individual's parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, children,
grandchildren, great-grandchildren, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and the similar family of the
individual's spouse/registered domestic partner unless the individual is widowed or divorced.
Board of Education members shall not engage in any employment or activity which is inconsistent with, incompatible
with, in conflict with or inimical to the Board member's duties as an officer of the district. (Government Code 1126) 
Board members shall not serve as Board members of the Redwood City Education Foundation.
The Board shall adopt for the district a conflict of interest code that incorporates the provisions of 2 CCR 18730 by
reference, specifies the district's designated positions, and provides the disclosure categories required for each
position. The conflict of interest code shall be submitted to the district's code reviewing body for approval, in
accordance with Government Code 87303 and within the deadline for submission established by the code reviewing
body. (Government Code 87303)
Upon direction by the code reviewing body, the Board shall review the district's conflict of interest code and submit
any changes to the code reviewing body or, if no change is required, the district shall submit a written statement to
that effect to the code reviewing body. If a change in the code is necessitated by changed circumstances, such as
the creation of new designated positions, amendments or revisions, the amended code shall be submitted to the
code reviewing body within 90 days after the changed circumstances necessitating the amendments have become
apparent. (Government Code 87306)
When reviewing and preparing the district's conflict of interest codes, the Superintendent or designee shall provide
officers, employees, consultants and members of the community adequate notice and a fair opportunity to present
their views. (Government Code 87311)
If a Board member or designated employee determines that they have a financial interest in a decision, as described
in Government Code 87103, this determination shall be disclosed. The member shall be disqualified from voting
unless their participation is legally required. (2 CCR 18700)
Board members and designated employees shall annually file a Statement of Economic Interest/Form 700 in
accordance with the disclosure categories specified in the district's conflict of interest code. A Board member who
leaves office or a designated employee who leaves district employment shall, within 30 days, file a revised statement
covering the period of time between the closing date of the last required statement and the date of leaving office or
district employment. (Government Code 87302, 87302.6)
Conflict of Interest under the Political Reform Act
A Board member, designated employee, or other person in a designated position shall not make, participate in
making, or in any way use or attempt to use their official position to influence a governmental decision in which they
know or have reason to know that they have a disqualifying conflict of interest. A disqualifying conflict of interest
exists if the decision will have a "reasonably foreseeable material financial effect," which is distinguishable from the
effect on the public generally, on the Board member, designated employee, or other person in a designated position,
their immediate family, or any financial interest described in 2 CCR 18700. (Government Code 87100, 87101,
87103; 2 CCR 18700-18709)
A Board member, designated employee, or other person in a designated position makes a governmental decision


when they, acting within the authority of their office or position, authorizes or directs any action on a matter, votes
or provides information or opinion on it, contacts or appears before a district official for the purpose of affecting the
decision, or takes any other action specified in 2 CCR 18704.
However, a Board member shall participate in the making of a contract in which they have a financial interest if their
participation is required by the rule of necessity or legally required participation pursuant to Government Code
87101 and 2 CCR 18705.
Conflict of Interest under Government Code 1090 - Financial Interest in a Contract
Board members, employees, or district consultants shall not be financially interested in any contract made by the
Board on behalf of the district, including in the development, preliminary discussions, negotiations, compromises,
planning, reasoning, and specifications and solicitations for bids. If a Board member has such a financial interest in a
contract made by the Board, the contract is void. (Government Code 1090)
A Board member shall not be considered to be financially interested in a contract in which they have only a "remote
interest," as specified in Government Code 1091, if the interest is disclosed during a Board meeting and noted in the
official Board minutes. The affected Board member shall not vote or debate on the matter or attempt to influence
any other Board member or district official to enter into the contract. (Government Code 1091)
In addition, a Board member shall not be considered to be financially interested in a contract in which their interest is
a "noninterest" as defined in Government Code 1091.5. Noninterest includes a Board member's interest in being
reimbursed for their actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties, in the
employment of their spouse/registered domestic partner who has been a district employee for at least one year prior
to the Board member's election or appointment, or in any other applicable circumstance specified in Government
Code 1091.5.
Common Law Doctrine Against Conflict of Interest
A Board member shall abstain from any official action in which their private or personal interest may conflict with
their official duties.
Incompatible Offices and Activities
Board members shall not engage in any employment or activity or hold any office which is inconsistent with,
incompatible with, in conflict with, or inimical to the Board member's duties as an officer of the district. 
(Government Code 1099, 1126)
Gifts
Board members and designated employees may accept gifts only under the conditions and limitations specified in
Government Code 89503 and 2 CCR 18730.
The limitation on gifts does not apply to wedding gifts and gifts exchanged between individuals on birthdays,
holidays, and other similar occasions, provided that the gifts exchanged are not substantially disproportionate in
value. (Government Code 89503)
In addition, the limitation on gifts does not apply to informational materials such as books, reports, pamphlets,
calendars, and periodicals. (Government Code 82028)
Gifts of travel and related lodging and subsistence shall be subject to the current gift limitation, except when: 
(Government Code 89506)
1. The travel is in connection with a speech given by a Board member or designated employee, provided the
lodging and subsistence expenses are limited to the day immediately preceding, the day of, and the day
immediately following the speech and the travel is within the United States.
 
2. The travel is provided by a person or agency specified in Government Code 89506, including a government,
governmental agency or authority, bona fide public or private educational institution, as defined in Revenue
and Taxation Code 203, or nonprofit organization exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code.


Gifts of travel exempted from the gift limitation, as described in items #1 and 2 above, shall nevertheless be
reportable on the recipient's Statement of Economic Interest/Form 700 as required by law.
A gift of travel does not include travel provided by the district for Board members and designated employees. 
(Government Code 89506)
Honoraria
Board members and designated employees shall not accept any honorarium, which is defined as any payment made
in consideration for any speech given, article published, or attendance at any public or private conference,
convention, meeting, social event, meal, or like gathering. (Government Code 89501, 89502)
The term honorarium does not include: (Government Code 89501)
1. Earned income for personal services customarily provided in connection with a bona fide business, trade, or
profession, unless the sole or predominant activity of the business, trade, or profession is making speeches
 
2. Any honorarium which is not used and, within 30 days after receipt, is either returned to the donor or
delivered to the district for donation into the general fund without being claimed as a deduction from income
for tax purposes
