The Governing Board desires to provide for the safe and efficient transportation of students to and from school as
necessary to ensure student access to the educational program, including expanded learning opportunities programs,
promote regular attendance, and reduce tardiness. In determining the extent to which the district will provide
transportation services, the Board shall weigh student and community needs against the cost of providing such
services.
The Superintendent or designee shall recommend to the Board economical, environmentally sustainable, and
appropriate means of providing transportation services. The district's transportation services may be provided by
means of a joint powers agreement, a cooperative student transportation program, or a consortium, as permitted by
law.
No student shall be required to be transported for any reason without the written permission of the student's
parent/guardian, except in emergency situations involving illness or injury to the student pursuant to Education Code
35350 or the evacuation of students as necessary for their safety.
Transportation Plan 
The Superintendent or designee shall develop a transportation plan in consultation with classified staff, teachers,
school administrators, regional local transit authorities, local air pollution control districts and air quality management
districts, parents/guardians, students, and other stakeholders. (Education Code 39800.1)
The transportation plan shall be presented to and adopted by the Board at an open meeting, with the opportunity for
in-person and remote public comment, and shall be updated annually by April 1. (Education Code 39800.1)

1. The transportation services offered to students
 
2. The prioritization of transportation services for low-income students, and students in transitional kindergarten,

pursuant to the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 USC 11301)
 
4. The manner in which unduplicated students, as defined in Education Code 42238.02, will be able to access
available home-to school transportation at no cost

In contracting for transportation services, the district shall comply with all applicable laws related to bids and
contracts. (Education Code 39802, 39803)
Prior to contracting with a private entity for student transportation services, the district shall obtain written
attestations from the entity that: (Education Code 39879)

and that the reports and documents shall be available for inspection by the district
 
Any vehicle used to provide student transportation for compensation shall meet both of the following requirements: 
(Education Code 39879)
1. Be inspected every 12 months, or every 50,000 miles, whichever comes first, at a facility licensed by the

except for vehicles which are already subject to a statutory inspection program

Expenses and Fees
In lieu of providing transportation in whole or in part, the district may pay the student's parents/guardians either
their actual and necessary expenses in transporting the student or the cost of the student's food and lodging at a
place convenient to the school. In either case, the amount of the payment shall not exceed the cost that would be
incurred by the district to provide for the transportation of the student to and from school. (Education Code 39806-
