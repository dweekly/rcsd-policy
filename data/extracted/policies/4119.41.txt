================================================================================

The Board of Education encourages each employee to inform the district as soon as possible if he/she contracts an
infectious disease which creates a physical or mental disability. The Board will reasonably accommodate the needs of
such individuals.
The Board may reassign or grant disability leave to an employee who is unable to perform his/her job responsibilities
because of illness or because the employee's illness significantly endangers his/her health or safety or the health or
safety of others.
No employee will be discriminated against because of his/her disability. Legal protections established for disabled
persons extend to individuals significantly impaired by infectious diseases.
When informed that an employee has a disabling infectious disease, the Superintendent or designee may request
that the employee sign a release form to provide confidential medical information and records.
In determining a reasonable accommodation of the employee's condition, the Superintendent or designee may
consult with public health officials or physicians with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious disease.
The Superintendent or designee may also communicate with the employee's physician regarding the employee's
ability to perform the essential requirements of the job with reasonable accommodation and without posing
significant health or safety risks to the employee or others.
The Superintendent or designee shall prepare a confidential report which includes his/her recommendation and the
medical information upon which it is based. These recommendations shall take into consideration:
1. The nature of the disease and the probability of its being transmitted, including the duration and severity of the
risk
 
2. The physical condition of the employee, including diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of the condition
 
3. The actual requirements of the employee's job and the expected type of interaction with others in the school
setting
This report shall be forwarded to the Board for confidential review and action.
The job assignment of an employee with a disabling infectious disease shall be reevaluated whenever there is a
change in medical knowledge or in the employee's medical regimen or health which might affect his/her assignment.
Confidentiality
The Board and the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that employee rights to confidentiality are strictly
observed. The district shall disclose medical record information only to the extent required or permitted by law. The
medical records of any employee with a disabling infectious disease shall be held in strict confidence.
