================================================================================

The Board of Education is committed to providing a safe, supportive, and positive school environment which is
conducive to student learning and to preparing students for responsible citizenship by fostering self-discipline and
personal responsibility. The Board believes that high expectations for student behavior, effective school and
classroom management strategies and parent involvement can minimize the need for disciplinary measures that
exclude students from instruction as a means for correcting student misbehavior. Staff shall use preventative
measures and positive conflict resolution techniques whenever possible.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop effective, age-appropriate strategies for maintaining a positive school
climate and correcting student misbehavior at district schools. The strategies shall focus on providing students with
needed supports; communicating clear, appropriate, and consistent expectations and consequences for student
conduct; and ensuring equity and continuous improvement in the implementation of district discipline policies and
practices.
In addition, the Superintendent or designee's strategies for correcting student misconduct shall reflect the Board's
preference for the use of positive interventions and alternative disciplinary measures over exclusionary discipline
measures.
Disciplinary measures that may result in loss of instructional time or cause students to be disengaged from school,
such as detention, suspension, and expulsion, shall be imposed only when required or permitted by law or when
other means of correction have been documented to have failed. (Education Code 48900.5)
School personnel and volunteers shall not allow any disciplinary action taken against a student to result in the denial
or delay of a school meal. (Education Code 49557.5)
The Superintendent or designee shall create a model discipline matrix that lists violations and the consequences for
each as allowed by law.
The administrative staff at each school may develop disciplinary rules to meet the school's particular needs
consistent with law, Board policy, and district regulations. The Board, at an open meeting, shall review the approved
school discipline rules for consistency with Board policy and state law. Site-level disciplinary rules shall be included in
the district's comprehensive safety plan. (Education Code 32282, 35291.5)
At all times, the safety of students and staff and the maintenance of an orderly school environment shall be priorities
in determining appropriate discipline. When misconduct occurs, staff shall implement appropriate discipline and
attempt to identify and address the causes of the student's behavior. When choosing between different disciplinary
strategies, staff shall consider the effect of each option on the student's health, well-being, and opportunity to learn.
Staff shall enforce disciplinary rules fairly, consistently and without discrimination.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide professional development as necessary to assist staff in developing the
skills needed to effectively implement the disciplinary strategies adopted for district schools, including, but not
limited to, consistent school and classroom management skills, effective accountability and positive intervention
techniques, and development of strong, cooperative relationships with parents/guardians.
District goals for improving school climate, based on suspension and expulsion rates, surveys of students, staff, and
parents/guardians regarding their sense of school safety, and other local measures, shall be included in the district's
local control and accountability plan, as required by law.
At the beginning of each school year, the Superintendent or designee shall report to the Board regarding disciplinary
strategies used in district schools in the immediately preceding school year and their effect on student learning.
