================================================================================

The Board of Education desires to represent the community and provide leadership in addressing community issues
related to education. In order to identify community concerns and enlist support for the schools, the Board shall
establish effective two-way communication systems between schools and the community.
Schools, parents/guardians, community members and local organizations must continually collaborate as partners.
The Board and the Superintendent or designee shall work together with city and county agencies and organizations
to promote and facilitate coordinated services for children, and shall seek to develop partnerships with local
businesses.
The Board recognizes that schools are an important community resource and encourages community members to
make appropriate use of school facilities. Community members are also encouraged to attend Board meetings,
participate in school activities, and take an active interest in issues that affect the schools. The Board and
Superintendent or designee shall keep community members well informed about district needs and accomplishments
and shall ensure that they have opportunities to share in developing educational policies, programs and evaluation
processes.
The Board recognizes that its ability to fulfill the community's expectations for a high-quality educational program
depends on the level of support provided by the state and federal government as well as the community. The Board
therefore shall study legislative processes and issues, establish ongoing relationships with state and local leaders and
the media, adopt positions on key issues, set priorities for advocacy, and collaborate with other organizations and
coalitions in legislative and legal advocacy efforts.
