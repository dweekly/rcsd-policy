The Governing Board is determined to provide a safe, positive environment where all district employees are assured
of full and equal employment access and opportunities, protection from harassment and intimidation, and freedom
from any fear of reprisal or retribution for asserting their employment rights in accordance with law. For purposes of
this policy, employees include job applicants, interns, volunteers, and persons who contracted with the district to
provide services, as applicable.
No district employee shall be discriminated against or harassed by any coworker, supervisor, manager, or other
person with whom the employee comes in contact in the course of employment, on the basis of the employee's
actual or perceived race, color, ancestry, national origin, age, religious creed, marital status, pregnancy, physical or
mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, ethnicity, parental status, veteran or military status, sex,
sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, or association with a person or group with one or
more of these actual or perceived characteristics.
The district shall not inquire into any employee's immigration status nor discriminate against an employee on the
basis of immigration status, unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the district is required to do so in order
to comply with federal immigration law. (2 CCR 11028) 
Discrimination in employment based on the characteristics listed above is prohibited in all areas of employment and
in all employment-related practices, including the following:
1. Hiring, compensation, terms, conditions, and other privileges of employment
 
2. Taking of adverse employment actions, such as termination or the denial of employment, promotion, job
assignment, or training 
 
3. Unwelcome conduct, whether verbal, physical, or visual, that is so severe or pervasive as to adversely affect an
employee's employment opportunities, or that has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the
employee's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment 
 
4. Actions and practices identified as unlawful or discriminatory pursuant to Government Code 12940 or 2 CCR
11006-11086, such as:
 
a. Sex discrimination based on an employee's pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or any related medical
condition or on an employee's gender, gender expression, or gender identity, including transgender
status 
 
b. Religious creed discrimination based on an employee's religious belief or observance, including religious
dress or grooming practices, or based on the district's failure or refusal to use reasonable means to
accommodate an employee's religious belief, observance, or practice which conflicts with an
employment requirement 
 
c. Requiring medical or psychological examination of a job applicant, or making an 1 inquiry into whether a
job applicant has a mental or physical disability or a medical condition or as to the severity of any such
disability or condition, without the showing of a job-related need or business necessity 
 
d. Failure to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an employee,
or to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with an employee who has requested such
accommodations in order to determine the effective reasonable accommodations, if any, to be provided
to the employee 
 
e. Requiring an applicant or employee to disclose information relating to the employee's reproductive
health decision making
The Governing Board also prohibits retaliation against any district employee who opposes any discriminatory
employment practice by the district or its employees, agents, or representatives or who complains, reports an
incident, testifies, assists or in any way participates in the district's complaint process pursuant to this policy. No
employee who requests an accommodation for any protected characteristic listed in this policy shall be subjected to
any punishment or sanction, regardless of whether the request was granted. (Government Code 12940; 2 CCR

Pursuant to Government Code 12964.5, as amended by SB 331 (Ch. 638, Statutes of 2021), the above prohibition
applies not only to claims or complaints of sexual harassment or sexual assault, but to those involving harassment or
discrimination based on any protected characteristic and to other unlawful employment practices under FEHA.
No employee shall, in exchange for a raise or bonus or as a condition of employment or continued employment, be
required to sign a releases of the employee's claim or right to file a claim against the district or a nondisparagement
agreement or other document that has the purpose or effect of preventing the employee from disclosing information
about harassment, discrimination, or other unlawful acts in the workplace, including any conduct that the employee
has reasonable cause to believe is unlawful. (Government Code 12964.5)
Complaints concerning employment discrimination, harassment, or retaliation shall immediately be investigated in
accordance with procedures specified in the accompanying administrative regulation.
Any supervisory or management employee who observes or has knowledge of an incident of prohibited
discrimination or harassment, including harassment of an employee by a nonemployee, shall report the incident to
the Superintendent or designated district coordinator as soon as practical after the incident. All other employees are
encouraged to report such incidents to their supervisor immediately.
The Superintendent or designee shall use all appropriate means to reinforce the district's nondiscrimination policy,
including providing training and information to employees about how to recognize harassment, discrimination, or
other prohibited conduct, how to respond appropriately, and components of the district's policies and regulations
regarding discrimination. The Superintendent or designee shall regularly review the district's employment practices
and, as necessary, shall take action to ensure district compliance with the nondiscrimination laws.
Any district employee who engages in prohibited discrimination, harassment, or retaliation or who aids, abets, incites,
compels, or coerces another to engage or attempt to engage in such behavior in violation of this policy shall be
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.
The district shall maintain and preserve all applications, personnel, membership, or employment referral records and
files for at least four years after the records are initially created or received or, for an applicant or a terminated
employee, for four years after the date the employment action was taken. However, when the district is notified that
a complaint has been filed with the California Civil Rights Department, records related to the employee involved shall
be maintained and preserved until the later of the first date after the time for filing a civil action has expired or the
first date after the complaint has been fully and finally disposed of and all administrative proceedings, civil actions,
appeals, or related proceedings have been terminated. (Government Code 12946)
