The Governing Board recognizes its obligations under state and federal to locate, identify, evaluate, and
provide equitable services to children voluntarily enrolled by their parents/guardians in private schools
located within the district.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that activities to locate, identify, and evaluate children with
disabilities enrolled by their parents/guardians in private schools within the district are comparable to
activities undertaken for individuals with disabilities aged three to 22 in public schools within the district. 
(Education Code 56171; 34 CFR 300.131)
The Superintendent or designee shall develop a budget for the provision of services to children with
disabilities enrolled by their parents/guardians in private school based on the proportionate share of federal
funds received and the number of eligible children, including the possibility of mid-year enrollees, and the
types of services to be provided.
