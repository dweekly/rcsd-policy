The Board believes that comprehensive sexual health education provides students with the knowledge and skills to
make healthy choices and prevent unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. The
Board supports the provision of comprehensive sexual health education that provides accurate information and
supports the positive development of young people.
The Superintendent or designee may appoint a coordinator and an advisory committee regarding the district's
comprehensive sexual health program. This advisory committee shall represent a divergence of viewpoints and may
participate in planning, implementing and evaluating the district's comprehensive sexual health education program.
The Board shall consider the advisory committee's recommendations when approving the district's program.
Parent/Guardian Notification and Excuse
At the beginning of each school year, or at the time of a student's enrollment, parents/guardians shall be notified
