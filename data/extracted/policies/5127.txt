Status: ADOPTED

================================================================================

Graduation ceremonies shall be held to recognize those students who have earned a diploma by successfully
completing the required course of study, satisfying district standards, and passing any required assessments. The
Board of Education believes that these students deserve a public celebration that recognizes the significance of their
achievement and encourages them to continue the pursuit of learning throughout their lives.
Disciplinary Considerations
In order to encourage high standards of student conduct and behavior, the principal may deny a student the privilege
of participating in graduation ceremonies and/or activities in accordance with school rules. School rules shall ensure
that prior to denial of the privilege(s), the student, and where practicable his/her parent/guardian, is made aware of
the grounds for such denial and that the student is given an opportunity to respond to the proposed denial. If
privilege(s) are to be denied, the student and parent/guardian shall receive written notice of the denied privilege and
the means whereby he/she may appeal this decision.
Honors and Awards
The Superintendent or designee shall identify school-sponsored awards which may be given during graduation
exercises. A separate awards program may be held to recognize graduating students receiving other school and
nonschool awards.
Elementary/Middle School Promotion Exercises
The Board desires that each elementary and middle school provide age-appropriate promotion exercises to
recognize students who have completed the school's course of study.
