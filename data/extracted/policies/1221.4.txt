================================================================================

Proposition 39, approved by California voters in the November 7, 2000, general election, provides that the
governing board of a school district may pursue the authorization and issuance of bonds by 55 percent vote of the
electorate. As a result of the passage of Proposition 39, language was added to the Education Code requiring school
districts passing a bond designated as a Proposition 39 bond election to establish a citizens’ oversight committee
(“Committee”) to actively review and report on the use of Proposition 39 bond proceeds.
As such, the District’s Board of Trustees shall establish a Committee to actively review and report on the use of bond
proceeds when a Proposition 39 bond is passed by the District. The Committee shall be formed to ensure such bond
proceeds are spent only on permissible purposes and not for any other purpose. The Committee shall be established
within sixty (60) days of the date that the Board enters the official election results in its minutes.
The procedures for selection and appointment of Committee members, conduct of meetings, an outline of the duties
of the Committee, and the scope of the Committee’s responsibilities to the public and the Board are set forth in
administrative regulations of the Board.
These references are not intended to be part of the policy itself, nor do they indicate the basis or authority
for the Governing Board to enact this policy. Instead, they are provided as additional resources for those interested in the subject matter
of the policy.
