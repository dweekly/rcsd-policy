================================================================================

To protect the health of all students and staff and to curtail the spread of infectious diseases, the Governing Board
shall cooperate with state and local public health agencies to encourage and facilitate immunization of all district
students against preventable diseases.
Each student enrolling for the first time in a district school, preschool, or child care and development program or
enrolling in or advancing to grade 7, shall present an immunization record from any authorized private or public
health care provider certifying that the student has received all required immunizations. Students shall be excluded
from school or exempted from immunization requirements only as allowed by law.
Transfer students shall be requested to present immunization records upon registration at district schools if possible. 
The Superintendent or designee may arrange for an authorized health care provider to administer immunizations at
school to any student whose parent/guardian has consented in writing. At the beginning of the school year,
parents/guardians shall be notified of their right to provide consent for the administration of an immunization to their
child at school. (Education Code 48980, 49403)
