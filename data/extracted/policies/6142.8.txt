The Governing Board believes that health education should foster the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that students
need in order to lead healthy lives and avoid high-risk behaviors, and that creating a safe, supportive, inclusive, and
nonjudgmental environment is crucial in promoting healthy development for all students. The district’s health
education program shall be part of a coordinated school health system which supports the physical, mental, and
social well-being of students and is linked to district and community services and resources.
Goals for the district’s health education program shall be designed to promote student wellness and shall be
developed in accordance with Board policy. Such goals shall include, but not be limited to, goals for nutrition
promotion and education, physical activity, and other school- based activities that promote student well-being.
The district shall provide a planned, sequential, research-based, and developmentally appropriate health education
curriculum for students in grades K-8 which is aligned with the state's content standards and curriculum framework
and integrated with other content areas of the district's curriculum. The Superintendent or designee shall determine
the grade levels and subject areas in which health-related topics will be addressed in accordance with law, Board
policy, and administrative regulation.
The Board intends for health education to be part of a coordinated school health system that links district, school,
and community programs and services to promote the health and well- being of students.
As appropriate, the Superintendent or designee shall involve school administrators, teachers, school nurses, health
professionals representing various fields of health care, parents/guardians, community-based organizations, and
other community members in the development, implementation, and evaluation of the district's health education
program. Health and safety professionals may be invited to provide related instruction in the classroom, school
assemblies, and other instructional settings.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide professional development as needed to ensure that health education
teachers are knowledgeable about academic content standards, the state curriculum framework, and effective
instructional methodologies.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide periodic reports to the Board regarding the implementation and
effectiveness of the district’s health education program, which may include, but not be limited to, a description of the
district's program and the extent to which it is aligned with the state's content standards and curriculum framework,
the amount of time allotted for health instruction at each grade level, student achievement of district standards for
health education, and the manner in which the district's health education program supports the physical, mental, and
social well-being of students.
