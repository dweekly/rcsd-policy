The Board of Education believes that the diversity that exists among the district's community of students, staff,
parents/guardians, and community members is integral to the district's vision, mission, and goals. Addressing the
needs of the most marginalized learners requires recognition of the inherent value of diversity and acknowledgement
that educational excellence requires a commitment to equity in the opportunities provided to students and the
resulting outcomes.
In order to eradicate institutional bias of any kind, including implicit or unintentional biases and prejudices that affect
student achievement, and to eliminate disparities in educational outcomes for students from historically underserved
and underrepresented populations, the district shall proactively identify class and cultural biases as well as practices,
policies, and institutional barriers that negatively influence student learning, perpetuate opportunity achievement
gaps, and impede equal access to opportunities for all students.
The Board shall make decisions with a deliberate awareness of impediments to learning faced by students of color
and/or diverse cultural, linguistic, or socio-economic backgrounds. To ensure that equity is the intentional result of
district decisions, the Board shall consider whether its decisions address the needs of students from racial, ethnic,
and indigent communities and remedy the inequities that such communities experienced in the context of a history
of exclusion, discrimination, and segregation. Board decisions shall not rely on biased or stereotypical assumptions
about any particular group of students.
The Board and the Superintendent or designee shall develop and implement policies and strategies to promote
equity in district programs and activities, through measures such as the following:
1. Routinely assessing student needs based on data disaggregated by race, ethnicity, and socio-economic and
cultural backgrounds in order to enable equity-focused policy, planning, and resource development decisions
 
2. Analyzing expenditures and allocating financial and human resources in a manner that provides all students
with equitable access to district programs, support services, and opportunities for success and promotes equity
and inclusion in the district. Such resources include access to high-quality administrators, teachers, and other
school personnel; funding; technology, equipment, textbooks, and other instructional materials; facilities; and
community resources or partnerships.
 
3. Enabling and encouraging students to enroll in, participate in, and complete curricular and extracurricular
courses, advanced college preparation programs, and other student activities
 
4. Building a positive school climate that promotes student engagement, safety, and academic and other supports
for students
 
5. Adopting curriculum and instructional materials that accurately reflect the diversity among student groups
 
6. Providing and/or collaborating with local agencies and community groups to ensure the availability of
necessary support services for students in need
 
7. Promoting the employment and retention of a diverse staff that reflects the student demographics of the
community
 
8. Providing district staff with ongoing, researched-based, professional learning and professional development on
culturally responsive instructional practices
 
9. Conducting program evaluations that focus on equity and address the academic outcomes and performance of
all students on all indicators
The Board shall regularly monitor the intent and impact of district policies and decisions in order to safeguard against
disproportionate or unintentional impact on access to district programs and achievement goals for specific student
populations in need of services.
