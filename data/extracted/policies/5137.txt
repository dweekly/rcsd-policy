================================================================================

The Board of Education desires to enhance student learning by providing an orderly, caring, and nurturing
educational and social environment in which all students can feel safe and take pride in their school and their
achievements. The school environment should be characterized by positive interpersonal relationships among
students and between students and staff while developing student leadership opportunities.
All staff are expected to serve as role models for students by demonstrating positive, professional attitudes and
respect toward each student and other staff members. Teachers shall use effective classroom management
techniques based on clear expectations for student behavior.
Staff shall consistently enforce Board policies and regulations which establish rules for appropriate student conduct,
including prohibitions against bullying, cyberbullying, harassment of students, hazing, other violence or threats of
violence against students and staff, and drug, alcohol, and tobacco use.
The district's curriculum shall include age-appropriate character education which includes, but is not limited to, the
principles of equality, human dignity, mutual respect, fairness, honesty, and citizenship. Teachers are encouraged to
employ cooperative learning strategies that foster positive interactions in the classroom among students from
diverse backgrounds.
The Superintendent or designee may develop other strategies to enhance students' feelings of connectedness with
the schools, such as campus beautification projects, graffiti removal, development of extracurricular activities and
after-school programs, pairing of adult mentors with individual students, recognition of student achievement, and
encouragement of strong family and community involvement in the schools.
Students shall have opportunities to voice their concerns about school policies and practices and to share
responsibility for solving problems that affect their school.
The schools shall promote nonviolent conflict resolution techniques in order to encourage attitudes and behaviors
that foster harmonious relations. As part of this effort, students shall be taught the skills necessary to reduce
violence, including communication skills, anger management, bias reduction, and mediation skills.
Staff shall receive professional development designed to improve classroom management, conflict resolution
techniques, and communications with students and parents/guardians including persons of diverse backgrounds.
