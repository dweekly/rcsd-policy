================================================================================

The Board of Education shall adopt written policies to convey its expectations for actions that will be taken in the
district, clarify roles and responsibilities of the Board and Superintendent, and communicate Board philosophy and
positions to the students, staff, parents/guardians and the community. Board policies are binding on the district to
the extent that they do not conflict with federal or state law and are consistent with the district's collective
bargaining agreements.
The Board recognizes the importance of maintaining a policy manual that is up to date and reflects the mandates of
law. Policies shall be regularly reviewed at a time allocated for this purpose on the agenda of public Board meetings.
The Board shall review certain policies annually, as required by Education Code 35160.5. If no revisions are deemed
necessary, the Board minutes shall nevertheless indicate that the review was conducted. Other policies shall be
monitored and reviewed as specified in the policy itself or as needed to reflect changes in law or district
circumstances.
Policy Development and Adoption Process
The district's policy development process shall include the following basic steps:
1. The Board and/or Superintendent or designee shall identify the need for a new policy or revision of an existing
policy. The need may arise from a change in law, a new district vision or goals, educational research or trends,
or a change in the superintendency or Board membership. The need may also occur as a result of an incident
that has arisen in the district or a recommendation or request from staff or other interested persons.
 
2. As needed, the Superintendent or designee shall gather fiscal and other data, staff and public input, related
district policies, sample policies from other organizations or agencies, and other useful information to fully
inform the Board Policy Committee about the issue.
 
3. The Board Policy Committee may consider how the proposed policy may affect student learning, community
expectations, staff recommendations, fiscal impact, as well as the policy's impact on governance and
operational efficiency.
 
4. The Board or Superintendent may request that legal counsel review the draft policy as appropriate.
 
5. The Superintendent or designee, along with the Board Policy Committee shall develop and present a draft
policy for a first reading at a public Board meeting. At its second reading, the Board may take action on the
proposed policy. The Board may waive the second reading or may require an additional reading if necessary.
Only policies formally adopted by a majority vote of the Board shall constitute official Board policy.
The district's policy development process may be revised or expanded as needed based on the issue being
considered, the need for more information, or to provide greater opportunities for consultation and public input.
Policies shall become effective upon Board adoption or at a future date designated by the Board at the time of
adoption.
Board Bylaws
The Board shall prescribe and enforce rules for its own government consistent with state law and regulations.
(Education Code 35010)
Bylaws governing Board operations may be developed, adopted, and amended following the same procedures as
those used for the adoption or amendment of Board policy.
Administrative Regulations
The Superintendent or designee shall be responsible for developing and enforcing administrative regulations for the
operation of the district. Administrative regulations shall be consistent with law and Board policy and shall be
designed to promote the achievement of district goals and objectives. Administrative regulations may describe
specific actions to be taken, roles and responsibilities of staff, timelines, and/or other necessary provisions. The

Policy Reference Disclaimer:
Superintendent or designee also may develop procedures manuals, handbooks, or other guides to carry out the
intent of Board policy.
When Board policies are amended, the Superintendent or designee shall review corresponding regulations to ensure
that they conform to the intent of the revised policy. In case of conflict between administrative regulation and Board
policy, policy shall prevail.
The Board may review and/or approve regulations for the purpose of ensuring conformity with the intent of Board
policy.
Monitoring and Evaluation
At the time a policy is adopted, the Board and Superintendent or designee shall determine whether an evaluation of
the policy should be scheduled and, if so, shall agree upon a timeline and measures for evaluating the effectiveness
of the policy in achieving its purpose.
Access to Policies
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all district employees and the public have access to an up-to-date
district policy manual. A public copy of the policy manual shall be maintained at the district central office and at each
school site. These copies shall be maintained either electronically or by paper copy.
As necessary, the Superintendent or designee shall notify staff, parents/guardians, students, and other stakeholders
whenever a policy that affects them is adopted or revised. He/she may determine the appropriate communications
strategy depending on the issue.
Suspension of Policies
No Board policy, bylaw, or administrative regulation, or any portion thereof, shall be operative if it is found to be in
conflict with applicable federal or state law or regulations or court decisions. If any portion of a policy is found to be
invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions of the policy.
