================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that district employees may create copyrightable materials at work, at home, or
both at work and at home. The development of copyrightable materials during, or in part during, the work day shall
be approved by the Superintendent or designee. However, the Superintendent or designee's approval or lack of
approval shall not affect the district's ownership of copyrights for materials developed during work hours.
Materials written or developed by an employee during the normal school day are considered district property.
(Education Code 60076, 17 USC 201)
Materials developed during both school and leisure hours are owned jointly by the employee and the district. In such
cases, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that a contractual agreement is made, clarifying the joint
ownership. A partnership entity may be created to hold the copyright on behalf of both parties.
The Board may secure copyrights in the name of the district for all copyrightable works developed by the district. All
royalties or revenues from these copyrights shall be used for the benefit of the district. (Education Code 35170)
The Board may market or license any noneducational mainframe electronic software developed by the district.
Proceeds from this marketing or licensing shall be used exclusively for educational purposes. (Education Code
35182)
