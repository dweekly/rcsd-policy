All or part of the special reserve fund of the district, or any surplus monies not required for the immediate necessities
of the district, may be invested as allowed by law for public funds. (Education Code 41015; Government Code
16430, 53601-53609, 53635)
The Board of Education authorizes the district's chief fiscal officer to invest and reinvest such funds on behalf of the
district. He/she shall make monthly reports of those transactions to the Board. The Board retains the right to revoke
this authority at any time.
The Board recognizes that the district's chief fiscal officer has fiduciary responsibility for any funds invested outside
the county treasury and is subject to prudent investor standards for investment decisions. As such, he/she shall act
with care, skill, prudence and diligence under the prevailing circumstances, including but not limited to the general
economic conditions and the anticipated needs of the district. The investment objectives shall be to first safeguard
the principal of the funds, then to meet the district's liquidity needs and, third, to achieve a return on the funds.
(Government Code 53600.3, 53600.5)
In order to enhance investment return, the district's goal shall be to generate an investment yield that attains or
exceeds a market-average rate of return through economic cycles.
The Board recognizes the importance of overseeing investments made with district funds, including investments by
the county treasurer. The Superintendent or designee shall maintain ongoing communication with any county
committee established for the purpose of overseeing county investments. In addition, the Superintendent or
designee shall keep the Board informed about county policies that guide the investment of these funds.
The Board may establish an investment oversight committee to monitor the district's investments and make
recommendations to the chief fiscal officer and the Board regarding investment policies.
Annual Statement of Investment Policy
The district's chief fiscal officer shall annually provide to the Board and any district investment oversight committee a
statement of the district's investment policy or, if all district surplus funds are invested with the county treasurer, the
county's investment policy.
The annual investment report shall be submitted no later than the end of the first quarter of the year to which it
applies.
At a public meeting, the Board shall review this policy and discuss any changes to be made. (Government Code
53646)
Quarterly Investment Reports
The chief fiscal officer of the district shall provide the Board, Superintendent and internal auditor with quarterly
reports of district investments in individual accounts that are $25,000 or more.
