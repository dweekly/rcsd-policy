The Board of Education believes that all students should have health and accident insurance protection to ensure
that they receive needed health care services in the event of illness or injury.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide information to students and their parents/guardians about available
insurance against injuries occurring during school-related activities, which may include printed matter furnished by
the insurer or membership corporation. Parents/guardians shall not be required to enroll their children in insurance
programs offered by the district.
Athletic Teams
Each student participating on a school athletic team shall have insurance protection in the amounts specified in law
and administrative regulation for medical and hospital expenses resulting from accidental bodily injury. (Education
Code 32221)
If a student does not have insurance protection or a reasonable equivalent of health benefits through other means,
including, but not limited to, purchase by the student or his/her parent/guardian, the district shall offer a medical or
hospital service or insurance program. (Education Code 32221)
The cost of the insurance protection shall be paid by the parent/guardian of an athletic team member or other
persons on the student's behalf.
However, if the parent/guardian is financially unable to pay the costs, the costs shall be paid by the district and/or
student body organization. (Education Code 32221)
Field Trips/Excursions
The district shall offer medical and/or hospital service or insurance protection for students injured while participating
in any excursion or field trip under the jurisdiction of, sponsored by, or controlled by the district. (Education Code
35331)
Parents/guardians choosing to participate in the insurance program offered by the district shall pay the costs of the
medical or hospital service or insurance protection.
