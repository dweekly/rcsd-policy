================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that student participation in fund-raising activities for the schools and nonprofit,
nonpartisan charitable organizations can help develop a sense of social responsibility in students, enhance the
relationship between the school and community, and contribute to the improvement of the school program.
Whether solicitations are made on behalf of the school or on behalf of a charitable organization, students shall not be
barred from an event or activity because they did not participate in fund-raising. Potential donors, including
parents/guardians and members of the community, should not be unduly pressured to contribute to the school
system or charitable organizations. Staff is expected to emphasize the fact that donations are always voluntary.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that parents/guardians are informed of the purpose of fund-raisers.
Solicitations on Behalf of the School
With the prior written approval of the Superintendent or designee, official school-related organizations may organize
fund-raising events involving students.
Solicitations on Behalf of Charities
When approved in advance by the Superintendent or designee, nonprofit, nonpartisan organizations that are
properly chartered or licensed by state or federal law may solicit students on school grounds during school hours and
within one hour before school has opened and one hour after school has closed. (Education Code 51520)
