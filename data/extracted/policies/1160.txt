The Board of Education has a responsibility to actively advocate fiscal and public policy that supports the district's
schools and the children in the community. To the extent possible, the Board shall be proactive in defining the
district's advocacy agenda based on the needs of the district and the direction set forth in the district's vision and
goals.
The Board may establish reasonable regulations related to Board members and employees engaging in political
activity during working hours and on district premises. (Education Code 7055)
Legislation
The Board's responsibility as an advocate for the district may include lobbying at the state and national levels.
Because local governments also make decisions which impact the district's schools, the Board and the
Superintendent or designee shall work to establish ongoing relationships with city and county officials and agencies,
and shall inform them of the potential effect of local issues on the schools.
The Board shall identify issues that will affect its schools and the children in its community, establish goals and
priorities for legislative advocacy, solicit community input and adopt legislative positions. The Superintendent or
designee shall establish a coordinated plan for carrying out the advocacy agenda, including specific activities, target
groups or individuals, staff responsibilities and timelines.
In order to strengthen legislative advocacy efforts, the district may work with organizations and coalitions and may
join associations whose representatives lobby on behalf of their members.
As necessary, the Superintendent or designee may draft legislative proposals which serve the district's interests.
The Board may provide fair and impartial information about legislative issues affecting schools and children and shall
inform the community about its legislative advocacy activities.
Ballot Measures/Candidates
The Board may study the potential effect of ballot measures on the district's schools. Any Board discussion of the
effect of such measures shall include an opportunity for Board members, staff and members of the public to speak
on all sides of the issue. Following such study, the Board may adopt positions in support of or in opposition to ballot
measures of importance to education.
The Board's positions shall be publicized only through normal district procedures for reporting Board actions and in a
manner that does not attempt to influence voters.
No district funds, services, supplies or equipment shall be used to urge the support or defeat of any ballot measure or
candidate, including any candidate for election to the Board. (Education Code 7054)
District resources shall not be used to disseminate campaign literature or to purchase advertisements, bumper
stickers, posters or similar promotional items that advocate an election result.
The Superintendent or designee may use district resources to provide students, parents/guardians and community
members with fair and impartial information related to ballot measures, including information about the impact of
ballot measures on the district. (Education Code 7054)
In preparing or distributing such information, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the totality of the
circumstances, including language, style, tenor and timing, does not expressly advocate passage or defeat of a
measure or candidate.
The Superintendent or designee may research, draft and prepare a bond measure or other initiative for the ballot, but
shall not use district resources to secure signatures in order to qualify the measure for the ballot.
Upon request, Board members and district administrators may appear at any time before a citizens' group to explain
why the Board called for an election on a bond measure and to answer questions. (Education Code 7054.1)
If the presentation occurs during working hours, the district representative shall not urge a citizens' group to vote for

or against the bond measure.
For informational purposes, the Superintendent or designee may conduct a poll related to a ballot issue. Such a poll
shall not advocate a particular position on the issue.
Legal Advocacy
The Board recognizes that some issues are more appropriately addressed judicially rather than legislatively. When a
legal issue is likely to set a state or national precedent, the district may join with other districts or parties in order to
challenge the issue through litigation or other appropriate means.
Political Forums
Forums on political issues may be held in district facilities as long as the forum is made available to all sides of the
issue on an equitable basis. (Education Code 7058)
