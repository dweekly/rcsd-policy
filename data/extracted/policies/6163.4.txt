================================================================================

The Board of Education intends that technological resources provided by the district be used in a safe, responsible,
and proper manner in support of the instructional program and for the advancement of student learning. All students
using these resources shall receive instruction in their proper and appropriate use.
Teachers, administrators, and/or library media specialists are expected to review the technological resources and
online sites that will be used in the classroom or assigned to students in order to ensure that they are appropriate for
the intended purpose and the age of the students.
The Superintendent or designee shall notify students and parents/guardians about authorized uses of district
technology, user obligations and responsibilities, and consequences for unauthorized use and/or unlawful activities in
accordance with this Board policy and the district's Acceptable Use Agreement.
District technology includes, but is not limited to, computers, the district's computer network including servers and
wireless computer networking technology (wi-fi), the Internet, email, USB drives, wireless access points (routers),
tablet computers, smartphones and smart devices, telephones, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants, pagers,
MP3 players, wearable technology, any wireless communication device including emergency radios, and/or future
technological innovations, whether accessed on or off site or through district-owned or personally owned equipment
or devices.
Before a student is authorized to use district technology, the student and his/her parent/guardian shall sign and
return the Acceptable Use Agreement. In that agreement, the parent/guardian shall agree not to hold the district or
any district staff responsible for the failure of any technology protection measures or user mistakes or negligence
and shall agree to indemnify and hold harmless the district and district staff for any damages or costs incurred.
The district reserves the right to monitor student use of technology within the jurisdiction of the district without
advance notice or consent. Students shall be informed that their use of district technology, including, but not limited
to, computer files, email, text messages, instant messaging, and other electronic communications, is not private and
may be accessed by the district for the purpose of ensuring proper use. Students have no reasonable expectation of
privacy in use of the district technology. Students' personally owned devices shall not be searched except in cases
where there is a reasonable suspicion, based on specific and objective facts, that the search will uncover evidence of
a violation of law, district policy, or school rules.
The Superintendent or designee may gather and maintain information pertaining directly to school safety or student
safety from the social media activity of any district student in accordance with Education Code 49073.6 and BP/AR
5125 - Student Records.
Whenever a student is found to have violated Board policy or the district's Acceptable Use Agreement, the principal
or designee may cancel or limit a student's user privileges or increase supervision of the student's use of the district's
equipment and other technological resources, as appropriate. Inappropriate use also may result in disciplinary action
and/or legal action in accordance with law and Board policy.
The Superintendent or designee, with input from students and appropriate staff, shall regularly review and update
procedures to enhance the safety and security of students using district technology and help ensure that the district
adapts to changing technologies and circumstances.
Internet Safety
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all district computers with Internet access have a technology
protection measure that protects against access to visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful
to minors, and that the operation of such measures is enforced. (20 USC 6777; 47 USC 254; 47 CFR 54.520)
The Board desires to protect students from access to inappropriate matter on the Internet. The Superintendent or
designee shall implement rules and procedures designed to restrict students' access to harmful or inappropriate
matter on the Internet. He/she also shall establish regulations to address the safety and security of students and
student information when using email, chat rooms, and other forms of direct electronic communication.
To reinforce these measures, the Superintendent or designee shall implement rules and procedures designed to
restrict students' access to harmful or inappropriate matter on the Internet and to ensure that students do not
engage in unauthorized or unlawful online activities.



Harmful matter includes matter, taken as a whole, which to the average person, applying contemporary statewide
standards, appeals to the prurient interest and is matter which depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way,
sexual conduct and which lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors. (Penal Code 313)
The district's Acceptable Use Agreement shall establish expectations for appropriate student conduct when using the
Internet or other forms of electronic communication, including, but not limited to, prohibitions against:
1. Accessing, posting, submitting, publishing, or displaying harmful or inappropriate matter that is threatening,
obscene, disruptive, or sexually explicit, or that could be construed as harassment or disparagement of others
based on their race/ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, or political
beliefs
 
2. Intentionally uploading, downloading, or creating computer viruses and/or maliciously attempting to harm or
destroy district equipment or materials or manipulate the data of any other user, including so-called "hacking"
 
3. Distributing personal identification information, including the name, address, telephone number, Social Security
number, or other personally identifiable information, of another student, staff member, or other person with
the intent to threaten, intimidate, harass, or ridicule that person
The Superintendent or designee shall provide age-appropriate instruction regarding safe and appropriate behavior on
social networking sites, chat rooms, and other Internet services. Such instruction shall include, but not be limited to,
the dangers of posting one's own personal identification information online, misrepresentation by online predators,
how to report inappropriate or offensive content or threats, behaviors that constitute cyberbullying, and how to
respond when subjected to cyberbullying.
