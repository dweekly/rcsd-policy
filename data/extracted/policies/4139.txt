In order to assist teachers who may need additional development in subject matter knowledge and/or teaching
strategies, the Board of Education shall work with the local teachers' organization to establish and maintain a
program of peer assistance and review linking participating teachers with exemplary teachers serving as consulting
teachers. Consulting teachers shall provide sustained, intensive support including, but not limited to, multiple
classroom observations, recommendations for staff development and regular meetings with participating teachers.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish in accordance with law a joint teacher-administrator peer review
panel to manage the program.
Board decisions regarding the continued employment of an individual participating teacher shall include
consideration of the results of the individual's participation in the peer assistance and review program and the
recommendations of the consulting teacher and review panel.
