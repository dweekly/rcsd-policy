================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that content and performance standards are necessary to clarify for students,
parents/guardians and staff what students are expected to know and be able to do at each grade level and in each
area of study. The Board shall adopt high standards for student achievement that meet or exceed statewide
standards and challenge all students to reach their full potential.
District achievement standards shall be developed through a process that involves staff, students, parents/guardians
and community members. Standards shall be based on a review of state model standards and an assessment of the
skills that students will need in order to be successful in high school and beyond, including basic skills, problem-
solving abilities and conceptual thinking. Special care shall be taken to ensure the proper articulation of standards
among district schools.
Staff shall continually assess students' progress toward meeting the achievement standards and shall offer remedial
assistance in accordance with Board policy. The standards shall also provide a basis for evaluating the instructional
program, making decisions about curriculum and assessment, and, as required by law, evaluating teacher
performance.
While desiring district achievement standards to be specific and comprehensive, the Board does not intend that
these standards be so extensive as to describe everything that will be taught in the classroom. Staff shall have
sufficient time and flexibility to provide instruction that supplements the standards. Staff have flexibility to
determine the best instructional methods to use in preparing students to meet the standards.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that district standards are regularly reviewed and updated as necessary.
