The Board of Education expects any charter school it authorizes to provide a sound educational program that
promotes student learning and to carry out its operations in a manner that complies with law and the terms of its
charter.
The Board may revoke a charter before the date it is due to expire whenever the Board makes a written factual
finding, supported by substantial evidence, that the charter school has done any of the following: (Education Code
47607)
1. Committed a material violation of any of the conditions, standards, or procedures set forth in the charter
 
2. Failed to meet or pursue any of the student outcomes identified in the charter
 
3. Failed to meet generally accepted accounting principles or engaged in fiscal mismanagement
 
4. Violated any provision of law
The Board shall also consider revocation of a charter whenever the California Collaborative for Educational
Excellence (CCEE), after providing advice and assistance to the charter school pursuant to Education Code 47607.3,
submits to the Board either of the following findings: (Education Code 47607.3)
1. That the charter school has failed or is unable to implement the recommendations of the CCEE
 
2. That the inadequate performance of the charter school, as based on an evaluation rubric adopted by the State
Board of Education (SBE), is so persistent or acute as to require revocation of the charter
In determining whether to revoke a charter, the Board shall consider increases in student academic achievement for
all "numerically significant" groups of students served by the charter school, as defined in Education Code 52052, as
the most important factor. (Education Code 47607, 47607.3)
At least 72 hours prior to any Board meeting at which the Board will consider issuing a Notice of Violation, the Board
shall provide the charter school with notice and all relevant documents related to the proposed action. (5 CCR
11968.5.2)
If the Board takes action to issue a Notice of Violation, it shall deliver the Notice of Violation to the charter school's
governing body. The Notice of Violation shall identify: (Education Code 47607; 5 CCR 11965, 11968.5.2)
1. The charter school's alleged violation(s).
 
2. All evidence relied upon by the Board in determining that the charter school committed the alleged violation(s),
including the date and duration of the alleged violation(s). The Notice shall show that each alleged violation is
both material and uncured and that it occurred within a reasonable period of time before the Notice of
Violation is issued.
 
3. The period of time that the Board has concluded is a reasonable period of time for the charter school to
remedy or refute the identified violation(s). In identifying this time period, the Board shall consider the amount
of time reasonably necessary to remedy each identified violation, which may include the charter school's
estimation as to the anticipated remediation time.
By the end of the remedy period identified in the Notice of Violation, the charter school's governing body may
submit to the Board a detailed written response and supporting evidence addressing each identified violation,
including the refutation, remedial action taken, or proposed remedial action. (5 CCR 11968.5.2)
Within 60 calendar days of the conclusion of the remedy period, the Board shall evaluate any response and
supporting evidence provided by the charter school's governing body and shall take one of the following actions: (5
CCR 11968.5.2)
1. Discontinue revocation of the charter and provide timely written notice of such action to the charter school's
governing body

Policy Reference Disclaimer:
2. If there is substantial evidence that the charter school has failed to remedy a violation identified in the Notice
of Violation or to refute a violation to the Board's satisfaction, continue revocation of the charter by issuing a
Notice of Intent to Revoke to the charter school's governing body
If the Board issues a Notice of Intent to Revoke, it shall hold a public hearing concerning the revocation on the date
specified in the notice, which shall be no later than 30 days after providing the notice. Within 30 calendar days after
the public hearing, or within 60 calendar days if extended by written mutual agreement of the Board and the charter
school, the Board shall issue a final decision to revoke or decline to revoke the charter. (Education Code 47607; 5
CCR 11968.5.2)
If the Board fails to meet the timelines specified above for issuing a Notice of Intent to Revoke or a final decision, the
revocation process shall be deemed terminated.
Within 10 calendar days of the Board's final decision, the Superintendent or designee shall provide a copy of the final
decision to the California Department of Education (CDE) and the County Board of Education. (Education Code
47604.32; 5 CCR 11968.5.2)
Severe and Imminent Threat
The procedures specified above shall not be applicable when the Board determines, in writing, that any violation
under Education Code 47607 constitutes a severe and imminent threat to the health or safety of students. In such
circumstances, the Board may immediately revoke the school's charter by approving and delivering a Notice of
Revocation by Determination of a Severe and Imminent Threat to Pupil Health or Safety to the charter school's
governing body, the County Board, and the CDE. (Education Code 47607; 5 CCR 11968.5.3)
Appeals
If the Board revokes a charter, the charter school may, within 30 days of the Board's final decision, appeal the
revocation to the County Board. Either the charter school or the district may subsequently appeal the County
Board's decision to the SBE. However, a revocation based upon the findings of the CCEE pursuant to Education
Code 47607.3 may not be appealed. (Education Code 47607, 47607.3; 5 CCR 11968.5.3-11968.5.5)
