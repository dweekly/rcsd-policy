The Board of Education recognizes that district employees may incur expenses in the course of performing their
assigned duties and responsibilities. To ensure the prudent use of public funds, the Superintendent or designee shall
establish rules to keep such expenses to a minimum while affording employees a reasonable level of safety and
convenience.
The Superintendent or designee may approve employee requests to attend meetings in accordance with the adopted
budget.
Expenses shall be reimbursed within limits approved by the Board. The Superintendent or designee shall establish
procedures for the submission and verification of expense claims. When necessary, the Superintendent or designee
may approve a cash advance, not to exceed the estimated out-of-pocket reimbursable expenses, to an employee
authorized to travel on district business. Within 10 working days following return from travel, the employee shall
submit a final accounting with all necessary supporting documentation. The employee shall refund to the district any
amount of cash advance exceeding the actual approved reimbursable expenses.
The Board may establish an allowance on either a mileage or monthly basis to reimburse authorized employees for
the use of their own vehicles in the performance of assigned duties.
All out-of-state travel for which reimbursement will be claimed shall have Superintendent's approval. Travel
expenses not previously budgeted also shall be approved on an individual basis by the Superintendent or designee if
it is determined that the travel is essential and that resources may be obtained or redirected for this purpose.
Reimbursable travel expenses may include, but are not limited to, costs of transportation, parking fees, bridge or road
tolls, lodging when district business reasonably requires an overnight stay, registration fees for seminars and
conferences, telephone and other communication expenses incurred on district business, and other necessary
incidental expenses.
The district shall not reimburse personal travel expenses including, but not limited to, alcohol, entertainment, laundry,
expenses of any family member who is accompanying the employee on district-related business, personal use of an
automobile, and personal losses or traffic violation fees incurred while on district business.
Except as otherwise provided, reimbursement of travel expenses shall be based on actual expenses as documented
by receipts.
Authorized employees shall be reimbursed for the use of their own private vehicles in the performance of assigned
duties, on either a mileage or monthly basis as determined by the Superintendent or designee. (Education Code
44033)
The mileage allowance provided by the district for employees' use of their private vehicles shall be equal to the rate
established by the Internal Revenue Service.
Vehicles should be shared whenever possible to minimize travel costs. No employee shall be entitled to
reimbursement for automobile travel when the employee is transported free of charge or by another employee who
is entitled to the expense reimbursement.
Meal costs shall be reimbursed based on documented actual expenses within the maximum amounts established by
the Superintendent or designee and based on the time of day that travel for district business begins and ends.
Any expense that exceeds the maximum rate of reimbursement established by the district shall be reimbursed only
with the approval of the Superintendent or designee.
All expense reimbursement claims shall be submitted on a district form, within 10 working days following return from
travel when possible. The form shall be accompanied by receipts and any explanation necessary to document that
the expenses meet district criteria for reimbursement.
The Superintendent or designee shall approve expense claims only upon verifying that all necessary documentation
is provided and that all expenses are appropriate and related to district business. If an expense claim is disallowed
