The Governing Board recognizes the immediate and long-term health benefits of breastfeeding and desires to provide a supportive 
environment for any district employee to express breast milk for an infant child upon returning to work following the birth of the 
child. The Board prohibits discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation against any district employee for seeking an 
accommodation to express breast milk for an infant child while at work.
An employee shall notify the employee's supervisor or other appropriate district administrator in advance of the intent to request an 
accommodation. The supervisor or appropriate district administrator shall respond to the request and shall work with the employee 
to make arrangements. If needed, the supervisor or appropriate district administrator shall address scheduling in order to ensure that 
the employee's essential job duties are covered during the break time.
Lactation accommodations shall be granted unless limited circumstances exist as specified in law. (Labor Code 1031, 1032; 29 
USC 218d, 42 USC 2000gg-1)
Before a determination is made to deny lactation accommodations to an employee, the employee's supervisor shall consult with the 
Superintendent or designee. When lactation accommodations are denied, the Superintendent or designee shall document the options 
that were considered and the reasons for denying the accommodations.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide a written response to any employee who was denied the accommodation(s). (Labor 
Code 1034)
The district shall include this policy in its employee handbook or in any set of policies that the district makes available to 
employees. In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall distribute the policy to new employees upon hire and when an 
employee makes an inquiry about or requests parental leave. (Labor Code 1034)
Break Time and Location Requirements
The district shall provide a reasonable amount of break time to accommodate an employee each time the employee has a need to 
express breast milk for an infant child. (Labor Code 1030; 42 USC 2000gg-1; 34 CFR 106.57)
To the extent possible, any break time granted for lactation accommodation shall run concurrently with the break time already 
provided to the employee. Any additional break time used by a non-exempt employee for this purpose shall be unpaid. (Labor Code 
1030; 29 USC 218d)
The employee shall be provided a lactation space which may be used by the employee for expressing breast milk or breastfeeding as 
needed. The lactation space shall be a private room or location, other than a bathroom, which may be the employee's work area or 
another location that is in close proximity to the employee's work area, and shall meet the following requirements: (Labor Code 
1031; 29 USC 218d; 34 CFR 106.57) 
1. Is shielded from view and free from intrusion while the employee is expressing breast milk
