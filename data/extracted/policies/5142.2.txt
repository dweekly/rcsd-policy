================================================================================

The Governing Board recognizes that walking, bicycling, and other forms of active transport to school increase
students' physical activity and reduce vehicle traffic and air pollution in the vicinity of schools. As part of the district's
coordinated approach to supporting student wellness and safety and enhancing student learning and achievement,
the Superintendent or designee shall develop and implement strategies to establish and encourage safe routes to
school program activities. 
All students shall have equitable access and opportunity to participate in the district's safe routes to school program. 
The Superintendent or designee may appoint a program coordinator and identify or establish district and/or school
site committees to oversee and coordinate related activities.
The Superintendent or designee may collaborate with local public works and public safety departments,
transportation agencies, other city and county agencies, school staff, students, parents/guardians and parent
organizations, health organizations, community organizations, and/or businesses in the development,
implementation, and evaluation of strategies. 
Strategies in support of the safe routes to school program shall be based on the grade levels of the students and an
assessment of the conditions and needs of each school and the surrounding neighborhoods. 
The Superintendent or designee shall explore the availability of grant funds and other sources of funding to support
related projects and activities. 
The Superintendent or designee shall periodically report to the Governing Board on the implementation of program
activities and progress toward program goals. Such reports may include, but are not limited to, levels of participation
in promotional and educational activities, survey results of parent/guardian attitudes about allowing their child to
walk or bicycle to school, tallies of the numbers of students using various modes of travel to and from school and
how these numbers have changed over time, records of student attendance and on-time arrival, and injury data
within the school and/or district attendance boundaries.
