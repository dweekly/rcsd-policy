================================================================================

As part of its commitment to provide a safe and healthful work environment, the Board of Education recognizes the
importance of developing an exposure control plan. The Superintendent or designee shall establish a written
exposure control plan in accordance with state and federal standards for dealing with potentially infectious materials
in the workplace to protect employees from possible infection due to contact with bloodborne pathogens, including
but not limited to hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
The Superintendent or designee shall determine which employees have occupational exposure to bloodborne
pathogens and other potentially infectious materials. In accordance with the district's exposure control plan,
employees having occupational exposure shall be offered the hepatitis B vaccination.
The Superintendent or designee may exempt designated first aid providers from pre-exposure hepatitis B
vaccination under the conditions specified by state regulations. (8 CCR 5193(f))
Any employee not identified by the Superintendent or designee as having occupational exposure may submit a
request to the Superintendent or designee to be included in the training and hepatitis B vaccination program. The
Superintendent or designee may deny a request when there is no reasonable anticipation of contact with any
infectious material.
