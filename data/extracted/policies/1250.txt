Original Adopted Date: 11/04/2009
The Board of Education believes that it is important for parents/guardians and community members to take an active
interest in the issues affecting district schools and students. Therefore, the Board encourages parents/guardians and
interested members of the community to visit the schools and participate in the educational programs.
To ensure the safety of students and staff and minimize interruption of the instructional program, the Superintendent
or designee shall establish procedures which facilitate visits during regular school days. Visits during school hours
should be first arranged with the teacher and principal or designee. If a conference is desired, an appointment should
be set with the teacher during noninstructional time.
Any person who is not a student or staff member shall register immediately in the school office upon entering any
school building or grounds when school is in session.
For purposes of school safety and security, the principal or designee may require a visible means of identification for
visitors who are not students or staff while on school premises.
No electronic listening or recording device may be used by students or visitors in a classroom without the teacher's
and principal's permission.
The Board encourages all individuals to assist in maintaining a safe and secure school environment by behaving in an
orderly manner while on school grounds and by utilizing the district's complaint processes if they have concerns with
any district program or employee. In accordance with Penal Code 626.7, the principal or designee may request that
any individual who is causing a disruption, including exhibiting volatile, hostile, aggressive, or offensive behavior,
immediately leave school grounds.
Presence of Sex Offender on Campus
Any person who is required to register as a sex offender pursuant to Penal Code 290, including a parent/guardian of
a district student, shall request written permission from the principal before entering the school campus or grounds.
As necessary, the principal shall consult with local law enforcement authorities before allowing the presence of any
such person at school or other school activity. The principal also shall report to the Superintendent or designee
anytime he/she gives such written permission.
