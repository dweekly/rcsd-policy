================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that tobacco use presents serious health risks and desires to ensure that, through
adoption of consistent policies, district students are made aware of those risks and, to the extent possible, protected
from them. The Superintendent or designee shall establish a coordinated school health system which includes a
behavioral health education component that teaches students the knowledge, skills, and attitudes they need in order
to lead healthy lives and avoid high-risk behaviors, such as tobacco use.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide prevention, intervention, and cessation education, information,
activities, and/or referrals to district students and shall ensure consistent enforcement of district policies prohibiting
student possession and use of tobacco products.
Students shall not possess, smoke or use tobacco, or any product containing tobacco or nicotine, while on campus,
while attending school-sponsored activities, or while under the supervision and control of district employees.
(Education Code 48901)
Smoking means inhaling, exhaling, burning, or carrying of any lighted or heated cigar, cigarette, pipe, tobacco, or plant
product intended for inhalation, whether natural or synthetic, in any manner or form, and includes the use of an
electronic smoking device that creates aerosol or vapor or of any oral smoking device for the purpose of
circumventing the prohibition of smoking. (Business and Professions Code 22950.5; Education Code 48901)
Tobacco products include: (Business and Professions Code 22950.5; Education Code 48901)
1. A product containing, made, or derived from tobacco or nicotine that is intended for human consumption,
whether smoked, heated, chewed, absorbed, dissolved, inhaled, snorted, sniffed, or ingested by any other
means, including, but not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, little cigars, chewing tobacco, pipe tobacco, or snuff
 
2. An electronic device that delivers nicotine or other vaporized liquids to the person inhaling from the device,
including, but not limited to, an electronic cigarette, cigar, pipe, or hookah
 
3. Any component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product, whether or not sold separately
These prohibitions do not apply to a student's possession or use of his/her own prescription products. However,
student possession or use of prescription products in school shall be subject to the district's policy and regulation for
addressing the administration of medications on campus. (Education Code 48900)
Prevention Instruction
The district shall provide developmentally appropriate tobacco-use prevention instruction for students at selected
grade levels from K-12 pursuant to Education Code 51202. Such instruction shall be aligned with state content
standards and the state curriculum framework for health education and with any requirements of state and/or
federal grant programs in which the district participates.
Intervention/Cessation Services
The district may provide or refer students to counseling, intensive education, and other intervention services to
assist in the cessation of tobacco use. Such intervention services may be provided as an alternative to suspension for
tobacco possession.
Program Planning
The district's tobacco-use prevention/intervention program shall be based on an ongoing assessment of objective
data regarding tobacco use in the schools and community and on research identifying strategies that have proven
effective in preventing or reducing tobacco use among youth, and a determination of high-risk student populations
that are most in need of district services.
The Superintendent or designee may coordinate with the local health department and county office of education in
program planning and implementation. He/she may establish an advisory council including students,
parents/guardians, district staff, representatives of the local health department and community organizations, law
enforcement professionals, and/or others with demonstrated expertise in tobacco prevention and cessation.

identified by the California Department of Education (CDE) and may adapt the model to meet district needs. (Health

use or sale of tobacco products. He/she also shall not accept tobacco-use prevention or intervention funds or
materials from the tobacco industry or from any entity which is known to have received funding from the tobacco
industry.
Program Evaluation
To evaluate the effectiveness of the district's program and ensure accountability, the Superintendent or designee

to strengthen program implementation.

the prevention or reduction of tobacco use.
