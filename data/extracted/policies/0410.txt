The Board of Education is committed to providing equal opportunity for all individuals in district programs and
activities. District programs, activities and practices shall be free from unlawful discrimination including
discrimination against an individual or group based on gender, sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, nationality, national
origin, immigration status, ethnic group identification, ethnicity, age, religion, marital or parental status, pregnancy,
physical or mental disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, or genetic
information, a perception of one or more of such characteristics; or association with a person or group with one or
more of these actual or perceived characteristics. The Board shall promote programs that ensure that discriminatory
practices are eliminated in all district activities.
All individuals shall be treated equitably in the receipt of district and school services. Personally identifiable
information collected in the implementation of any district program, including, but not limited to, student and family
information for the free and reduced-price lunch program, transportation, or any other educational program, shall be
used only for the purposes of the program, except when the Superintendent or designee authorizes its use for
another purpose in accordance with law. Resources and data collected by the district shall not be used, directly or by
others, to compile a list, registry, or database of individuals based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion,
ethnicity, national origin, or immigration status or any other category identified above.
District programs and activities shall be free of any racially derogatory or discriminatory school or athletic team
names, mascots, or nicknames.
The Superintendent or designee shall annually review district programs and activities to ensure the removal of any
derogatory or discriminatory name, image, practice, or other barrier that may unlawfully prevent an individual or
group in any of the protected categories stated above from accessing district programs and activities. They shall take
prompt, reasonable actions to remove any identified barrier. The Superintendent or designee shall report their
findings and recommendations to the Board after each review.
All allegations of unlawful discrimination in district programs and activities shall be investigated and resolved in
accordance with the procedures specified in AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.
Pursuant to 34 CFR 104.8 and 34 CFR 106.9, the Superintendent or designee shall notify students,
parents/guardians, employees, employee organizations, applicants for admission and employment, and sources of
referral for applicants about the district's policy on nondiscrimination and related complaint procedures. Such
notification shall be included in the annual parental notification distributed pursuant to Education Code 48980 and,
as applicable, in announcements, bulletins, catalogs, handbooks, application forms, or other materials distributed by
the district. The notification shall also be posted on the district's web site and social media and in district schools and
offices, including staff lounges, student government meeting rooms, and other prominent locations as appropriate.
In addition, the annual parental notification shall inform parents/guardians of their children's right to a free public
education regardless of immigration status or religious beliefs, including information on educational rights issued by
the California Attorney General. Alternatively, such information may be provided through any other cost-effective
means determined by the Superintendent or designee. (Education Code 234.7)
The district's nondiscrimination policy and related informational materials shall be published in a format that
parents/guardians can understand. In addition, when 15 percent or more of a school's students speak a single
primary language other than English, those materials shall be translated into that other language.
Access for Individuals with Disabilities
District programs and facilities, viewed in their entirety, shall be in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) and any implementing standards and/or regulations. When structural changes to existing district facilities
are needed to provide individuals with disabilities access to programs, services, activities, or facilities, the
Superintendent or designee shall develop a transition plan that sets forth the steps for completing the changes.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district provides auxiliary aids and services when necessary to
afford individuals with disabilities equal opportunity to participate in or enjoy the benefits of a service, program or
activity. These aids and services may include, but are not limited to, qualified interpreters or readers, assistive
listening devices, assistive technologies or other modifications to increase accessibility to district and school web
sites, note takers, written materials, taped text, and Braille or large print materials. Individuals with disabilities shall
