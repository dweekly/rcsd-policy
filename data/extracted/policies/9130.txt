The Board of Education may establish Board committees as necessary. The Board shall determine the duties of the
committee at the time of its appointment. Unless specifically authorized by the Board to act on its behalf, Board
committees shall act in an advisory capacity. When its duties have been completed, the committee shall be dissolved.
Board committees shall provide public notice of their meetings and conduct these meetings in accordance with state
open meeting laws.
Meetings of advisory committees or standing committees for which an agenda is posted at least 72 hours in advance
of the meeting pursuant to Government Code 54954.2, shall be considered, for purposes of the Brown Act, as
regular meetings of the Board. (Government Code 54954)
Board advisory committees composed solely of less than a quorum of the members of the Board are not subject to
open meeting laws unless they are standing committees that have a continuing subject matter jurisdiction or a
meeting schedule established by the Board. (Government Code 54952)
Standing committees with a continuing subject matter jurisdiction include but are not limited to those responsible for
providing advice on budgets, audits, contracts and personnel matters at the Board's request.
When a majority of the members of the Board attend an open and noticed meeting of a standing committee, the
Board members who are not members of the standing committee shall attend only as observers. (Government Code
54952.2)
The Superintendent or designee may serve as an advisor to any committee at the discretion of the Board.
Whenever so charged, committees may actively seek input and participation by parents/guardians, staff, community
and students and may consult with local public boards and agencies.
When a Board committee composed exclusively of Board members has provided for public comment on an item at a
public meeting before or during the committee's consideration of the item, the Board is not obliged to provide for
public comment on the item at a subsequent Board meeting. Public comment shall be afforded, however, if the
Board determines that the item has been substantially changed since it was heard by the committee. (Government
Code 54954.3)
