The Board of Education recognizes that distance learning can be a viable alternative instructional strategy that
supports student achievement of academic goals. Distance learning opportunities may be offered to students
participating in independent study, credit recovery courses, enrichment courses, or other courses identified by the
Superintendent or designee, or in the event that a school site is physically closed due to widespread illness, natural
disaster, or other emergency.
The district may offer distance teaching and learning through a variety of delivery methods as appropriate for the
grade level and subject matter. Distance teaching and learning opportunities shall include video, audio, and/or
written instruction in which the primary mode of communication between the student and teacher is online
interaction, instructional television, live or prerecorded video, telecourses, and other instruction that relies on
computer or communications technology.
Distance Teaching and Learning may also include the use of print materials with written or oral feedback.
The Superintendent or designee shall review and select distance learning courses, which may include those taught by
district staff or others that are of high academic quality and are aligned with district standards and curricula. The
Superintendent or designee shall also set standards for the delivery of distance teaching and learning instruction.
Direct teacher instruction shall be provided in conjunction with curriculum and other supports. As appropriate, and
with permission of a supervisor, courses may be self-directed to allow students to complete assignments at their
own pace and/or may involve real-time interaction between the teacher and students.
The Superintendent or designee shall, in collaboration with teachers, plan for schoolwide or long-term distance
learning in the event of a school closure. In developing the plan, the Superintendent or designee shall analyze the
course sequence, prioritize content and standards to be completed, and recommend the grading criteria. In such
circumstances, students' social-emotional wellness shall be taken into account, and schedules and learning
experiences shall be designed to build continuity, routine, and regular connections with students.
As needed, the Superintendent or designee shall provide teachers with training and ongoing support, including
technological support and guidance, to effectively implement distance learning. The district shall also provide
opportunities for teachers to communicate and collaborate with each other to exchange information on effective
practices. The Superintendent or designee may specify additional documentation means by which teachers report on
their activities implementing distance teaching and learning.
Staff shall comply with all copyright regulations in developing materials to be used in distance education courses.
The district shall take steps to ensure that distance learning opportunities are available to all students, including
economically disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, and English learners. Teachers may use multiple
methods of providing instruction to meet student needs. All online programming and Internet content shall meet
accessibility standards for students with disabilities, including compatibility with commonly used assistive
technologies.
The Superintendent or designee shall assess students' access to technological devices and the Internet and,
consistent with the district's budget and technology plan, may loan devices to students to use at home and/or assist
families in identifying free service providers. Students are expected to use district technology responsibly in
accordance with the district's Acceptable Use Agreement. Students and parents/guardians may not record video or
audio or take screenshots or photographs of synchronous instruction during distance learning without written
permission from the relevant teacher or instructor for instructional purposes. To the extent possible, the district shall
make technical and academic support available to students.
Teachers shall provide regular communications to students and parents/guardians about expectations, assignments,
and available resources to assist the student in successful completion of distance learning coursework.
Grading of distance learning assignments and assessments of end-of-course knowledge and understanding of the
subject matter shall be consistent with district policy on grading for equivalent courses.
