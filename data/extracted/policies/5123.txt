Cautionary Notice 2010-13: AB 1610 (Ch. 724, Statutes of 2010) amended Education Code 37252.2 to relieve
districts from the obligation, until July 1, 2013, to perform any activities that are deemed to be reimbursable state
mandates under that section. As a result, certain provisions of the following policy or administrative regulation
that reflect those requirements may be suspended.
The Board of Education expects students to progress through each grade level within one school year. To accomplish
this, instruction should accommodate the variety of ways that students learn and include strategies for addressing
academic deficiencies when needed.
Students shall progress through the grade levels by demonstrating growth in learning and meeting grade-level
standards of expected student achievement.
When high academic achievement is evident, the Superintendent or designee may recommend a student for
acceleration into a higher grade level. The student's maturity level shall be taken into consideration in making a
determination to accelerate a student.
As early as possible in the school year, the Superintendent or designee shall identify students who should be retained
and who are at risk of being retained in accordance with law, Board policy, administrative regulation, and the
following criteria.
Students shall be identified on the basis of grades. The following other indicators of academic achievement shall also
be used:
Informal assessment test results
When any student in grades 2-8 is retained or recommended for retention, the Superintendent or designee shall
offer programs of direct, systematic, and intensive supplemental instruction in accordance with Education Code
37252.2 and Board policy.
