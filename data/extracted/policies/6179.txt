Reporting assessments and the minimum levels of proficiency recommended by the State Board of Education.

students who do not demonstrate sufficient progress towards passing the exit exam and shall receive
supplemental instruction designed to help them succeed on the exit exam. (Education Code 37252)
 
3. Eligible students from low-income families whenever the district or a district school receiving federal Title I
