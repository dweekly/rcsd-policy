================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes the value of technology such as social media platforms in promoting community
involvement and collaboration. The purpose of any official district social media platform shall be to further the
district's vision and mission, support student learning and staff professional development, and enhance
communication with students, parents/guardians, staff, and community members.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop content guidelines and protocols for official district social media
platforms to ensure the appropriate and responsible use of these resources and compliance with law, Board policy,
and regulation.
Guidelines for Content
Official district social media platforms shall be used only for their stated purposes and in a manner consistent with
this policy and administrative regulation. By creating these official sites and allowing for public comment, the Board
does not intend to create a limited public forum or otherwise guarantee an individual's right to free speech.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the limited purpose of the official district social media platforms is
clearly communicated to users. Each site shall contain a statement that specifies the site's purposes along with a
statement that users are expected to use the site only for those purposes. Each site shall also contain a statement
that users are personally responsible for the content of their posts.
Official district social media platforms may not contain content that is obscene, libelous, or so incites students as to
create a clear and present danger of the commission of unlawful acts on school premises, violation of school rules, or
substantial disruption of the school's orderly operation.
Staff or students who post prohibited content shall be subject to discipline in accordance with district policies and
administrative regulations.
Users of official district social media platforms should be aware of the public nature and accessibility of social media
and that information posted may be considered a public record subject to disclosure under the Public Records Act.
The Board expects users to conduct themselves in a respectful, courteous, and professional manner.
Privacy
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the privacy rights of students, parents/guardians, staff, Board
members, and other individuals are protected on official district social media platforms.
Board policy pertaining to the posting of student photographs and the privacy of telephone numbers, home
addresses, and email addresses, as specified in BP 1113 - District and School Web Sites, shall also apply to official
district social media platforms.
Social media and networking sites and other online platforms shall not be used by district employees to transmit
confidential information about students, employees, or district operations.
