The Board of Education desires to prevent exposure of students to foods to which they are allergic and to provide
for prompt and appropriate treatment in the event that a severe allergic reaction occurs at school.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop guidelines for the care of food-allergic students. Such guidelines shall
include, but not be limited to, strategies for identifying students at risk for allergic reactions, avoidance measures and
other means to manage allergies, education of staff regarding typical symptoms, and actions to be taken in the event
of a severe allergic reaction.
Parents/guardians shall be responsible for notifying the Superintendent or designee, in writing, regarding any food
allergies or other special dietary needs of their child in accordance with administrative regulation.
Students with serious dietary needs that qualify as a disability under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act or
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act shall be provided reasonable accommodation or services, as
appropriate, in accordance with his/her accommodation plan or individualized education program.
