================================================================================

The Board of Education respects each student's individual right to freedom of religious practice, and religious
indoctrination is clearly forbidden in the public schools. Instruction about religion shall not promote or denigrate the
beliefs or customs of any particular religion or sect, nor should a preference be shown for one religious viewpoint
over another. Staff members shall be highly sensitive to their obligation not to interfere with the religious
development of any student in whatever tradition the student embraces.
Staff shall not endorse, encourage or solicit religious or anti-religious expression or activities among students during
class time. As part of their official duties, staff shall not lead students in prayer or other religious activities.
Students may express their beliefs about religion in their homework, artwork and other class work if the expression is
germane to the assignment. Such work shall be judged by ordinary academic standards.
While teaching about religious holidays is a permissible part of the educational program, celebrating religious
holidays is not allowed in the public schools. School-sponsored programs shall not be, nor have the effect of being,
religiously oriented or a religious celebration. School and classroom decorations may express seasonal themes that
are not religious in nature.
Music, art, literature or drama programs having religious themes are permitted as part of the curriculum for school-
sponsored activities and programs if presented in an objective manner and as a traditional part of the cultural and
religious heritage. The use of religious symbols that are part of a religious holiday is permitted as a teaching aid or
resource provided that such symbols are displayed as an example of cultural and religious heritage of the holiday and
are temporary in nature.
