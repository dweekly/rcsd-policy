================================================================================

The district shall purchase equipment, supplies and services using competitive bidding when required by law and in
accordance with statutory requirements for bidding and as specified in the district's administrative regulation. In those
circumstances where the law does not require competitive bidding, the Governing Board may request that a contract be
competitively bid if the Board determines that it is in the best interest of the district to do so.
When the Board has determined that it is in the best interest of the district, the Board may piggyback onto the contract of
another public agency or corporation to lease or purchase equipment or supplies to the extent authorized by law.
To ensure that good value is received for funds expended, specifications shall be carefully designed and shall describe in
detail the quality, delivery and service required.
To assist the district in determining whether bidders are responsible, the Board may require prequalification procedures as
allowed by law and specified in administrative regulation.
The California Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act (CUPCCAA)
The California Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act (CUPCCAA), Public Contract Code Section 22000 et seq.,
allows the District to follow its procedures to change both the dollar amount limitations and the advertising procedures
ordinarily applicable in competitive bidding. Rather than the usual $15,000 bid limit for public projects applicable to school
districts, under CUPCCAA, public works projects may be performed as follows:
Projects of $60,000 or less may be performed by force account, negotiated contract, or purchase order.
Projects of $200,000 or less may be let to contract by so-called “informal bidding procedures” established in CUPCCAA.
However, if all bids received are in excess $200,000, the Board may, by adoption of a resolution by a 4/5 vote, award the
contract, at $212,500 or less, to the lowest responsible bidder, if it determines the cost estimate of the public agency was
reasonable.
Projects of more than $200,000 remain subject to "formal bidding procedures" set forth in Public Contract Code Sections
22037 and 22038.
In electing to become subject to CUPCCAA, the district has implemented and will adhere to detailed notice and accounting
systems published in the Cost Accounting Policies and Procedures Manual published by the California Uniform Public
Construction Cost Accounting Commission.
