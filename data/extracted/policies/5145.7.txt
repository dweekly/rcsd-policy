================================================================================

The Governing Board is committed to maintaining a safe school environment that is free from harassment and
discrimination. The Board prohibits, at school or at school-sponsored or school-related activities, sexual harassment
targeted at any student by anyone. The Board also prohibits retaliatory behavior or action against a person who
reports, complains, testifies about, assists or otherwise participates in the complaint process established pursuant to
this policy and the administrative regulation.
The district strongly encourages any students who feel that they are being or have been sexually harassed on school
grounds or at a school-sponsored or school-related activity by another student or an adult, or who has experienced
off-campus sexual harassment that has a continuing effect on campus to immediately contact their teacher, the
principal, or any other available school employee. Any employee who receives a report or observes an incident of
sexual harassment shall immediately notify the Title IX Coordinator.
Once notified, the Title IX Coordinator shall ensure the complaint or allegation is addressed through AR 5145.71 -
Title IX Sexual Harassment Complaint Procedures or BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures, as applicable. 
Because a complaint or allegation that is dismissed or denied under the Title IX complaint procedure may still be
subject to consideration under state law, the Title IX Coordinator shall ensure that any implementation of AR
5145.71 concurrently meets the requirements of BP/AR 1312.3.
The Title IX Coordinator shall offer supportive measures to the complainant and respondent, as deemed appropriate
under the circumstances. 
The Superintendent or designee shall inform students and parents/guardians of the district's sexual harassment
policy by disseminating it through parent/guardian notifications, publishing it on the district's web site, and including
it in student and staff handbooks. All district staff shall be trained regarding the policy.
Instruction/Information
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all district students receive age-appropriate
instruction and information on sexual harassment. Such instruction and information shall include:
1. What acts and behavior constitute sexual harassment, including the fact that sexual harassment could occur
between people of the same sex and could involve sexual violence
 
2. A clear message that students do not have to endure sexual harassment under any circumstance
 
3. Encouragement to report observed instances of sexual harassment, even where the victim of the harassment
has not complained
 
4. A clear message that student safety is the district's primary concern, and that any separate rule violation
involving an alleged victim or any other person reporting a sexual harassment incident will be addressed
separately and will not affect the manner in which the sexual harassment complaint will be received,
investigated, or resolved
 
5. A clear message that, regardless of a complainant's noncompliance with the writing, timeline, or other formal
filing requirements, every sexual harassment allegation that involves a student, whether as the complainant,
respondent, or victim of the harassment, shall be investigated and prompt action shall be taken to stop any
harassment, prevent recurrence, and address any continuing effect on students
 
6. Information about the district's procedure for investigating complaints and the person(s) to whom a report of
sexual harassment should be made
 
7. Information about the rights of students and parents/guardians to file a civil or criminal complaint, as
applicable, including the right to file a civil or criminal complaint while the district investigation of a sexual
harassment complaint continues
 
8. A clear message that, when needed, the district will implement supportive measures to ensure a safe school
environment for a student who is the complainant or victim of sexual harassment and/or other students during



an investigation
Upon completion of an investigation of a sexual harassment complaint, any student found to have engaged in sexual
harassment or sexual violence in violation of this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action. For students in grades
4-8, disciplinary action may include suspension and/or expulsion, provided that, in imposing such discipline, the
entire circumstances of the incident(s) shall be taken into account.
Upon investigation of a sexual harassment complaint, any employee found to have engaged in sexual harassment or
sexual violence toward any student shall have their employment terminated in accordance with law and the
applicable collective bargaining agreements.
Record-Keeping
In accordance with law and district policies and regulations, the Superintendent or designee shall maintain a record of
all reported cases of sexual harassment to enable the district to monitor, address and prevent repetitive harassing
behavior in its schools.
