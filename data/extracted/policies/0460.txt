================================================================================

The Governing Board desires to ensure the most effective use of available funding to improve outcomes for all
students. A comprehensive, data-driven planning process shall be used to identify annual goals and specific actions
and to facilitate continuous improvement of district practices.
The Board shall adopt a districtwide local control and accountability plan (LCAP), based on the template adopted by the State
Board of Education (SBE), that addresses the state priorities in Education Code 52060 and any local priorities adopted by the
Board. The LCAP shall be updated on or before July 1 of each year and, like the district budget, shall cover the next fiscal
year and subsequent two fiscal years. (Education Code 52060, 52064; 5 CCR 15494-15497)
The LCAP shall focus on improving outcomes for all students, particularly those who are "unduplicated students" or are part
of any numerically significant student subgroup that is at risk of or is underperforming.
Unduplicated students include students who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals, English learners, and foster youth, as
defined in Education Code 42238.01 for purposes of the local control funding formula. (Education Code 42238.02)
Numerically significant student subgroups include ethnic subgroups, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, English
learners, students with disabilities, foster youth, and homeless students, when there are at least 30 students in the subgroup
or at least 15 foster youth or homeless students, or as otherwise defined by the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI). 
(Education Code 52052)
Beginning July 1, 2025, if the district is identified by the California Department of Education (CDE) as needing an
improvement plan pursuant to 34 CFR 300.600-300.647, the Board shall adopt, and update on an annual basis, an Individual
with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Addendum, based on the template adopted by SBE. However, if the district adopts an
improvement plan after being identified, but before July 1, 2025, the IDEA Addendum shall be developed upon expiration of
the adopted improvement plan, but no later than July 1, 2028, whichever occurs first. The IDEA addendum shall be
developed, reviewed, and approved in conjunction with and in the same manner as the LCAP and the annual update to the
LCAP, and shall be submitted to CDE within 15 days of adoption by the Board. (Education Code 52064.3)
The Superintendent or designee shall review the single plan for student achievement (SPSA) submitted by each district school
pursuant to Education Code 64001 to ensure that the specific actions included in the LCAP are consistent with strategies
included in the SPSA. (Education Code 52062)
The LCAP shall also be aligned with other district and school plans to the extent possible in order to minimize duplication of
effort and provide clear direction for program implementation.
As part of the LCAP adoption and annual update to the LCAP, the Board shall separately adopt an LCFF budget overview for
parents/guardians, based on the template developed by the SBE, which includes specified information relating to the district's
budget. The budget overview shall be adopted, reviewed, and approved in the same manner as the LCAP and the annual
update. (Education Code 52064.1)
Any complaint that the district has not complied with legal requirements pertaining to the LCAP may be filed pursuant to AR
1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures. (Education Code 52075)
Plan Development
The Superintendent or designee shall gather data and information needed for effective and meaningful plan development and
present it to the Board and community. Such data and information shall include, but not be limited to, data regarding the
number of students in student subgroups, disaggregated data on student achievement levels, and information about current
programs and expenditures.
The Board shall consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, employee bargaining units,
parents/guardians, and students in developing the LCAP. Consultation with students shall enable unduplicated students and
other numerically significant student subgroups to review and comment on LCAP development and may include surveys of
students, student forums, student advisory committees, and/or meetings with student government bodies or other groups
representing students. (Education Code 52060; 5 CCR 15495)
Public Review and Input
Board Policy Manual
Redwood City School District

The Board shall establish a parent advisory committee to provide advice on the LCAP. The committee shall be composed of a
majority of parents/guardians and shall include at least one parent/guardian of an unduplicated student as defined above and
parents/guardians of students with disabilities. (Education Code 52063; 5 CCR 15495)
Beginning July 1, 2024, unless a student advisory committee is established to provide advice to the Board and
Superintendent, two students shall be included as full members of the parent advisory committee. The students shall serve
for a renewable term of one full school year. (Education Code 52063)
Student members of the parent advisory committee or the student advisory committee shall represent the diversity of the
district's students, including geographical, socioeconomic, cultural, physical, and educational diversity, and particular effort
shall be made to reach out to at-risk or disadvantaged students to serve as members of such committees. (Education Code
52063)
Whenever district enrollment includes at least 15 percent English learners, with at least 50 students who are English learners,
the Board shall establish an English learner parent advisory committee composed of a majority of parents/guardians of
English learners to review and comment on the LCAP. (Education Code 52063; 5 CCR 15495)
The Superintendent or designee shall present the LCAP to the committee(s) before it is submitted to the Board for adoption,
and shall respond in writing to comments received from the committee(s).
The Superintendent or designee shall notify members of the public of the opportunity to submit written comments regarding
the specific actions and expenditures proposed to be included in the LCAP. The notification shall be provided using the most
efficient method of notification possible, which may not necessarily include producing printed notices or sending notices by
mail. All written notifications related to the LCAP shall be provided in the primary language of parents/guardians when
required by Education Code 48985. (Education Code 52062)
As part of the parent and community engagement process, the district shall solicit input on effective and appropriate
instructional methods, including, but not limited to, establishing language acquisition programs to enable all students,
including English learners and native English speakers, to have access to the core academic content standards and to become
proficient in English. (Education Code 305-306)
The Superintendent or designee shall consult with the administrator(s) of the special education local plan area of which the
district is a member to ensure that specific actions for students with disabilities are included in the LCAP and are consistent
with strategies included in the annual assurances support plan for the education of students with disabilities. (Education Code
52062)
The Board shall hold at least one public hearing to solicit the recommendations and comments of members of the public
regarding the specific actions and expenditures proposed to be included in the LCAP. The public hearing shall be held at the
same meeting as the budget hearing required pursuant to Education Code 42127 and AR 3100 - Budget. (Education Code
42127, 52062)
Adoption of the Plan
The Board shall adopt the LCAP prior to adopting the district budget, but at the same public meeting. This meeting shall be
held after the public hearing described above, but not on the same day as the hearing.
The Board may adopt revisions to the LCAP at any time during the period in which the plan is in effect, provided the Board
follows the process to adopt the LCAP pursuant to Education Code 52062 and the revisions are adopted in a public meeting. 
(Education Code 52062)
Submission of Plan to County Superintendent of Schools
Not later than five days after adoption of the LCAP, the Board shall file the LCAP with the County Superintendent of
Schools. (Education Code 52070)
If the County Superintendent sends, by August 15, a written request for clarification of the contents of the LCAP, the Board
shall respond in writing within 15 days of the request. If the County Superintendent then submits recommendations for
amendments to the LCAP within 15 days of receiving the Board's response, the Board shall consider those recommendations
in a public meeting within 15 days of receiving the recommendations. (Education Code 52070)

If the County Superintendent does not approve the district's LCAP, the Board shall accept technical assistance from the
County Superintendent focused on revising the plan so that it can be approved. (Education Code 52071)
Monitoring Progress
The Superintendent or designee shall report to the Board, at least annually in accordance with the timeline and indicators
established by them and the Board, regarding the district's progress toward attaining each goal identified in the LCAP. 
Evaluation shall include, but not be limited to, an assessment of district and school performance reported on the California
School Dashboard. Evaluation data shall be used to recommend any necessary revisions to the LCAP.
The Superintendent or designee shall seek and/or accept technical assistance or other intervention that may be required
pursuant to Education Code 52071 or 52072 when a school or a numerically significant student subgroup is not making
sufficient progress toward the goals in the LCAP.
