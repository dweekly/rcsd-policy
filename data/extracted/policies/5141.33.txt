================================================================================

The Board of Education believes that the district's head lice management program should emphasize the correct
diagnosis and treatment of head lice in order to minimize disruption of the education process and to reduce the
number of student absences resulting from infestation. In consultation with the school nurse, the Superintendent or
designee may establish a routine screening program to help prevent the spread of head lice.
School employees shall report all suspected cases of head lice to the school nurse or designee as soon as possible.
The nurse or designee may examine other students who are siblings of the affected student or members of the same
household.
If a student is found with active, adult head lice, the parent/guardian of the student shall receive information about
recommended treatment procedures and sources of further information. The student shall be allowed to return to
school the next day. The student shall be rechecked within seven (7) to ten (10) days. The District also expects that
parents/guardians provide for treatment.
The principal and school nurse shall work with the parents/guardians of any student who has been deemed to have
chronic head lice in order to help minimize the student's absences from school.
When a student in any class has been identified as having a head lice infestation, the principal may send information
about head lice home to all parents/guardians of the students in that class.
Staff shall maintain the privacy of students identified as having head lice.
