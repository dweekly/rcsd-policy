================================================================================

When district-owned books, equipment and supplies become unusable, obsolete, or no longer needed, the
Superintendent or designee shall identify these items to the Board of Education, together with their estimated value
and a recommendation that they be sold or disposed of by one of the methods prescribed in law and administrative
regulations. With Board approval, the Superintendent or designee shall arrange for the sale or disposal of these
items.
Instructional materials may be considered obsolete or unusable when they:
1. Contain information rendered inaccurate or incomplete by new discoveries or technologies
 
2. Have been replaced by more recent versions or editions of the same material and are of no foreseeable value
in other instructional areas
 
3. Contain demeaning, stereotyping or patronizing references to persons on account of their sex or sexual
orientation, members of racial, ethnic, religious, vocational or cultural groups, or persons with physical or
mental disabilities
 
4. Have been inspected and discovered to be damaged beyond use or repair
The Superintendent or designee shall establish procedures to be used when selling equipment for which the federal
government has a right to receive all or part of the proceeds. These procedures shall ensure a reasonable amount of
competition so as to result in the highest possible revenue.
