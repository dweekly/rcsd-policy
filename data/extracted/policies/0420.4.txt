================================================================================

The following policy establishes procedures for the review of charter petitions. These schools shall operate under the
provisions of their charters, federal laws, specified state laws, and general oversight of the Board.
The Board of Education recognizes that charter schools may assist the district in offering diverse learning
opportunities for students. In considering any petition to establish a charter school within the district, the Board shall
give thoughtful consideration to the potential of the charter school to provide students with a high-quality education
that enables them to achieve to their fullest potential.
One or more persons may submit a petition for a start-up charter school to be established within the district. In
addition, an existing district school may be converted to a charter school when deemed beneficial by the district and
community. (Education Code 47605, 47606, 53300)
The district shall not require any district student to attend the charter school nor shall it require any district
employee to work at the charter school. (Education Code 47605)
Any petition for a start-up charter school or conversion charter school shall include all components and signatures
required by law and shall be submitted to the Board. The Superintendent or designee shall consult with legal counsel,
as appropriate, regarding compliance of the charter proposals with legal requirements.
The Superintendent or designee may work with charter school petitioners prior to the formal submission of the
petition in order to gather information about the proposal and suggest components that would align the petition with
the district's vision and goals for student learning. As needed, they may work with the petitioners to establish
workable plans for technical assistance or contracted services, which the district may provide to the proposed
charter school.
Within 30 days of receiving a petition to establish a charter school, the Board shall hold a public hearing to determine
the level of support for the petition by teachers, other employees of the district, and parents/guardians. (Education
Code 47605)
Within 60 days of receiving a petition, or within 90 days with mutual consent of the petitioners and the Board, the
Board shall either approve or deny the request to establish the charter school. (Education Code 47605)
The approval or denial of a charter petition shall not be controlled by collective bargaining agreements nor subject to
review or regulation by the Public Employment Relations Board. (Education Code 47611.5)
Approval of Petition
The Board shall approve the charter petition if doing so is consistent with sound educational practice. In granting
charters, the Board shall give preference to schools best able to provide comprehensive learning experiences for
academically low-achieving students according to standards established by the California Department of Education
(CDE) under Education Code 54032. (Education Code 47605)
The Board may initially grant a charter for a specified term not to exceed five years. (Education Code 47607)
The Board shall ensure that any approved charter contains adequate processes and measures for holding the school
accountable for fulfilling the terms of its charter. These shall include, but are not limited to, fiscal accountability
systems, multiple measures for evaluating the educational program, including student outcomes aligned with state
priorities as described in Education Code 52060, and regular reports to the Board.
The Board may approve one or more memoranda of understanding to clarify the financial and operational
agreements between the district and the charter school. Any such memorandum of understanding shall be annually
reviewed by the Board and charter school governing body and amended as necessary.
It shall be the responsibility of the petitioners to provide written notice of the Board's approval and a copy of the
charter to the County Superintendent of Schools, the CDE, and the State Board of Education (SBE). (Education Code
47605)
Denial of Petition
Board Policy Manual
Redwood City School District

Policy Reference Disclaimer:
The Board shall deny any petition to authorize the conversion of a private school to a charter school. The Board shall
also deny any petition for a charter that proposes to serve students in a grade level that is not served by the district,
unless the petition proposes to serve students in all the grade levels served by the district. (Education Code 47602,
47605)
Any other charter petition shall be denied only if the Board makes written factual findings specific to the petition
that one or more of the following conditions exist: (Education Code 47605)
1. The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the students to be enrolled in the charter
school.
 
2. The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition.
 
3. The petition does not contain the number of signatures required.
 
4. The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code 47605(d).
 
5. The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of the charter provisions in Education
Code 47605(b).
 
6. The petition does not contain a declaration as to whether or not the charter school shall be deemed the
exclusive public school employer of the school's employees for purposes of collective bargaining pursuant to
Government Code 3540-3549.3.
The Board shall not deny a petition based on the actual or potential costs of serving students with disabilities, nor
shall it deny a petition solely because the charter school might enroll students with disabilities who reside outside the
special education local plan area in which the district participates. (Education Code 47605.7, 47647)
If the Board denies a petition, the petitioners may choose to submit the petition to the County Board of Education
and, if then denied by the County Board, to the SBE. (Education Code 47605)
