================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that it is accountable to students, parents/guardians, and the community for the
effectiveness of the district's educational program in meeting district goals for student learning. The Superintendent
or designee shall conduct a continual evaluation of the curriculum and the instructional program in order to improve
student achievement.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide the Board and the community with regular reports on student progress
toward Board-established standards of expected achievement at each grade level in each area of study. In addition,
he/she shall evaluate and report data for each district school and for every numerically significant subgroup of the
student population, including, but not limited to, school and subgroup performance on statewide achievement
indicators.
Based on these reports, the Board shall take appropriate actions to maintain the effectiveness of programs and to
improve the quality of education that district students receive.
Categorical Program Monitoring
The Superintendent or designee shall cooperate with the California Department of Education (CDE) in the
categorical program monitoring process to ensure that district categorical programs comply with federal and state
laws and regulations. The Superintendent or designee shall report to the Board regarding the results of this
monitoring process.
On an ongoing basis, the Superintendent or designee shall conduct a district self-evaluation which may utilize tools
developed by the district or the CDE to ensure compliance of district categorical programs with legal requirements.
Evaluation of Consolidated Categorical Programs
The Superintendent or designee and the Board shall annually determine whether the district's categorical programs
funded through the state's consolidated application are supportive of the core curriculum and are effective in
meeting the needs of the students they are intended to serve. As a basis for this evaluation, the Superintendent or
designee shall recommend for Board approval the specific, measurable criteria that shall be used at each school and
at the district level. These criteria shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, progress toward goals contained in
the school's single plan for student achievement and progress of the total student population and each numerically
significant subgroup toward growth targets on the statewide Academic Performance Index.
Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) Accreditation
The Board believes that accreditation by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) can foster
excellence and ongoing academic improvement in the district's schools. The results of the accreditation process also
may demonstrate to parents/guardians and the community that the schools are meeting their goals and objectives
and the WASC criteria for school effectiveness through a viable instructional program.
The Superintendent or designee shall undertake procedures whereby district schools may achieve and maintain full
WASC accreditation status. The schools shall conduct a self-study in accordance with WASC requirements,
cooperate with the WASC committee during a site visit, and develop and review action plans to increase the
effectiveness of the instructional program for students. The Superintendent or designee shall regularly report to the
Board on the status of district schools and any WASC recommendations for school improvement.
The results of any inspection of a school by WASC, or any other the accrediting agency, shall be published not later
than 60 days after the results are made available to the school. Publication shall be by notifying each parent/guardian
in writing and/or by posting the information on the district's or school's web site, as determined by the
Superintendent or designee. (Education Code 35178.4)
If any district school loses its accreditation status, the Board shall give official notice at a regularly scheduled Board
meeting. The Superintendent or designee shall provide written notification to each parent/guardian of a student in
the school that the school has lost its accreditation status, including the potential consequences of the loss of
accreditation status. This notice shall also be posted on the district's web site and the school's web site. (Education
Code 35178.4)
