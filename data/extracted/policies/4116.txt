The Board of Education desires to employ and retain highly qualified certificated personnel to implement the
district's educational program. Newly hired certificated personnel shall serve a probationary period during which the
Board shall determine their suitability for long-term district employment.
Certificated employees who satisfactorily complete the probationary period shall be granted permanent status.
Permanent Status
Granting of permanent status shall be based on completion of the probationary period in accordance with applicable
law. Employees granted permanent status acquire specific rights under the Education Code, including those relating
to discipline and dismissal. (Education Code 44932-44988)
A probationary employee who has been employed by the district in position(s) requiring certification for two
complete consecutive school years and is then reelected for the next succeeding school year shall become a
permanent employee at the beginning of the third year. (Education Code 44929.21, 44929.23)
During the probationary period, employees shall receive professional development and assistance which may consist
of inservice training and/or meetings with the employee's evaluator to discuss areas of strength and areas requiring
improvement. Inservice training may be provided during school hours as part of a comprehensive staff development
program.
The performance of each probationary employee shall be evaluated and assessed at least once every school year.
Dismissal/Nonreelection of Probationary Employees
During the school year, a probationary employee may be suspended or dismissed only for cause and in accordance
with district procedures. (Education Code 44948.3)
With proper notice, the Board may, without cause, elect not to reemploy a probationary employee for the
subsequent year. (Education Code 44929.21, 44929.23)
The Superintendent or designee shall annually provide the Board with recommendations regarding the reelection or
nonreelection of probationary certificated personnel for the ensuing school year.
At any time during a probationary employee's first year of employment in the district, the Board may give written
notice to the employee of the Board's decision not to reelect the employee for a second school year. If the Board
does not give written notice, the employee shall be deemed reelected for the next succeeding school year.
During the final year of the probationary period, the Board may decide not to reelect the employee for the following
year, and shall so notify the employee in writing on or before March 15. If the Board does not give written notice on
or before March 15, the employee shall be deemed reelected for the next succeeding school year. (Education Code
44929.21, 44948.5)
Such notices shall be delivered through personal service upon the employee, certified mail with return receipt, email,
or another method which documents actual receipt of the notice by the employee.
