================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that the number of students in a class may affect the extent to which teachers
can identify and respond to individual student needs.
In accordance with negotiated employee agreements and state law, and upon the recommendation of the
Superintendent or designee, the Board shall establish upper and lower class size limits appropriate for the grade level
or subject taught and conducive to the effective use of teaching staff.
The Superintendent or designee shall regularly submit reports that will enable the Board to evaluate the
effectiveness of the class size reduction program and its impact on student achievement and on the attainment of
the district's goals. These reports shall also include an analysis of the impact of class size reduction on staffing and
school facilities needs.
Class Size Reduction in Grades K-3
The Board believes that small class size is beneficial to students in the primary grades as they acquire the basic skills
that serve as the foundation for their subsequent learning. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that classes
in primary grades designated by the Board are reduced to 20 students as long as money is available for compliance
with class size reduction regulations.
Full-time mainstreamed special education students shall be included in determining class size for purposes of the
class size reduction program.
In accordance with law, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the teachers of classes in the class size
reduction program receive training designed to help them to maximize the educational advantages of class size
reduction.
If it becomes necessary to consider reducing or eliminating certain grade levels or schools from participation in the
class size reduction program, the Superintendent or designee shall prepare a report analyzing the potential impact of
the program's elimination, including the effects on the district's budget, transportation, facilities, staffing and
collective bargaining agreement, as well as the potential impact on student achievement and learning. He/she shall
present recommendations to the Board in accordance with the priorities specified in law.
