The Board of Education is committed to ensuring the fiscal health of the district and providing public accountability.
The Board shall adopt sound fiscal policies, oversee the district's financial condition, and ensure that the financial
systems support the district's goals for student achievement.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide the Board with financial reports throughout the year in accordance
with law and as otherwise requested by the Board.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all financial reports are prepared in accordance with law and in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and financial reporting standards stipulated by the
Governmental Accounting Standards Board and the California Department of Education.
The Board shall regularly communicate the district's financial position to the public and shall use financial reports to
determine what actions and budget amendments, if any, are needed to ensure the district's financial stability.
If district conditions predict fiscal distress or indicate that the district might not be able to meet its fiscal obligations,
the Board and Superintendent or designee shall act quickly to identify and resolve these conditions. The Board shall
work cooperatively with the County Superintendent of Schools to improve the district's fiscal health and may
contract with an external individual or organization to advise the district on fiscal matters.
Audit Committee
The Board may establish an audit committee composed of staff knowledgeable in fiscal matters, other staff, and
representatives of the community. The committee shall serve in an advisory capacity to the Board and shall:
1. Make recommendations regarding the selection of the external independent auditor
 
2. Review the plan for the audit process with the independent auditor to determine the adequacy of the nature,
scope, and timetable of the audit
 
3. Review the results of the audit and participate with the independent auditor and management in preparing
final recommendations and responses
 
4. Participate with the independent auditor in presenting the audit report to the Board
 
5. Review Board policies and administrative regulations to recommend any revisions needed to ensure effective
financial reporting
 
6. Provide input on the effectiveness of the independent auditor
 
7. Periodically report to the Board regarding the status of previous audit recommendations for improving the
accounting and internal control systems
Fiscal Policy Team
The Board may establish a fiscal policy team to periodically review the district's fiscal policies and procedures and
advise the Board regarding long-range fiscal management plans. The fiscal policy team may be assigned to examine
the fiscal and economic information needs of the district, the impact of budget allocations on district priorities, the
financial health of the district, or other duties specified by the Board. The team shall work with the district's budget
and audit committees and appropriate staff in carrying out its functions.
