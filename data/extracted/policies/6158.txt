================================================================================

The Governing Board authorizes independent study as an optional alternative instructional strategy for students
whose needs may be best met through study outside of the regular classroom setting. Independent study shall offer
a means of individualizing the educational plan to serve students who desire a more challenging educational
experience, whose health or other personal circumstances make classroom attendance difficult, who are unable to
access course(s) due to scheduling problems, and/or who need to make up credits or fill gaps in their learning. As
necessary to meet student needs, independent study may be offered for short- or long-term placements, on a full-
time basis or on a part-time basis in conjunction with part- or full-time classroom study.
The Board shall hold a public hearing when considering the scope of its existing or prospective use of independent
study as an instructional strategy, its purposes in authorizing independent study, and factors bearing specifically on
the maximum realistic lengths of assignments and acceptable number of missed assignments for specific populations
of students or adult education students. (Education Code 51747; 5CCR 11701)
The Superintendent or designee may provide a variety of independent study opportunities, including, but not limited
to, through a program or class within a comprehensive school, an alternative school or program of choice, a charter
school, and an online course.
Student participation in independent study shall be voluntary and no student shall be required to participate.
(Education Code 51747, 51749.5, 51749.6)
Independent study for each student shall be under the general supervision of a district employee who possesses a
valid certification document pursuant to Education Code 44865 or an emergency credential pursuant to Education
Code 44300. Students' independent study shall be coordinated, evaluated, and documented, as prescribed by law
and reflected in the accompanying administrative regulation. (Education Code 51747.5)
The minimum period of time for any independent study option shall be three consecutive school days. (Education
Code 46300)
General Independent Study Requirements
The Superintendent or designee may continue to offer and approve independent study for an individual student
upon determining that the student is prepared to meet the district's requirements for participation and is likely to
succeed as well as or better than the student would in the regular classroom setting.
The minimum instructional minutes shall be the same for all students at each school including students participating
in independent study, except as otherwise permitted by law. (Education Code 46100)
Because excessive leniency in the duration of independent study assignments may result in a student falling behind
peers and increase the risk of dropping out of school, independent study assignments shall be completed no more
than one week after assigned for all grade levels and types of programs. When necessary, based on the specific
circumstances of the student's approved program, the Superintendent or designee may allow for a longer period of
time between the date an assignment is made and when it is due, specified in the student’s written agreement.
An evaluation shall be conducted to determine whether it is in a student's best interest to remain in independent
study whenever the student fails to make satisfactory educational progress and/or misses three assignments.
Satisfactory educational progress shall be determined based on all of the following indicators: (Education Code
51747)
1. The student's achievement and engagement in the independent study program, as indicated by the student's
performance on applicable student-level measures of student achievement and engagement specified in
Education Code 52060
 
2. The completion of assignments, assessments, or other indicators that evidence that the student is working on
assignments
 
3. Learning required concepts, as determined by the supervising teacher
 


4. Progress towards successful completion of the course of study or individual course, as determined by the
supervising teacher
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that students participating in independent study are provided with
content aligned to grade level standards at a level of quality and intellectual challenge substantially equivalent to in-
person instruction. 
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all students participating in independent study for 15 school days
or more receive the following throughout the school year: (Education Code 51747)
 1. For students in grades transitional kindergarten, kindergarten, and grades 1 to 3, opportunities for daily
synchronous instruction
 2. For students in grades 4-8, opportunities for both daily live interaction and at least weekly synchronous
instruction
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that procedures for tiered reengagement strategies are used for
students participating in an independent study program for 15 school days or more who are:
Not generating attendance for more than three school days or 60 percent of the instructional days in a school week,
or ten percent of required minimum instructional time over four continuous weeks of the district's approved
instructional calendar
Not participating in synchronous instructional offerings pursuant to Education Code 51747.5 for more than 50
percent of the scheduled times of synchronous instruction in a school month as applicable by grade span
In violation of their written agreement
Tiered reengagement strategies procedures used in district independent study programs shall include, local programs
intended to address chronic absenteeism, as applicable, including but are not necessarily limited to, all of the
following: (Education Code 51747)
1. Verification of current contact information for each enrolled student
 
2. Notification to parents/guardians of lack of participation within one school day of the recording of a
nonattendance day or lack of participation
 
3. A plan for outreach from the school to determine student needs, including connection with health and social
services as necessary
 
4. A clear standard for requiring a student-parent-educator conference to review a student's written agreement
and reconsider the independent study program's impact on the student's achievement and well-being.
The Superintendent or designee shall, for students who participate in an independent study program for 15 school
days or more, develop a plan to transition students whose families wish to return to in-person instruction from
independent study expeditiously, and, in no case, later, than five instructional days. This requirement only applies to
students participating in an independent study program for 15 school days or more. (Education Code 51747)
When any student enrolled in classroom-based instruction is participating in independent study due to necessary
medical treatment or inpatient treatment for mental health or substance abuse under the care of appropriately
licensed professionals, the student shall be exempt from the live interaction and/or synchronous instruction, tiered
reengagement strategies, and transition back to in-person instruction requirements specified above. In such cases,
evidence from appropriately licensed professionals, of the student’s need to participate in independent study, shall
be submitted to the Superintendent or designee. (Education Code 51747)
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that a written agreement exists for each participating student as
prescribed by law. (Education Code 51747, 51749.5)
Upon the request of the parent/guardian of a student, and before signing a written agreement as described below in
the section "Master Agreement", the district shall conduct a telephone, videoconference, or in-person student-
parent-educator conference or other meeting during which the student, parent/guardian, and, if requested by the
parent/guardian, an advocate may ask questions about the educational options, including which curriculum offerings

and nonacademic supports will be available to the student in independent study. (Education Code 51747)
Master Agreement
