In addition, pursuant to 5 CCR 350, constitutionally permissible fees can be charged only when specifically
authorized by law. See the accompanying administrative regulation for a list of such fees.
The Board of Education desires to furnish books, materials and instructional equipment as needed for the educational
program. Because the needs of the district must be met with limited available funds, the Board may charge fees
when specifically authorized by law.
The district shall consider the student and parent/guardian's ability to pay when establishing fee schedules and
granting exceptions.
