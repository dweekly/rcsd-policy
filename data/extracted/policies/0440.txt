================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that technological resources can enhance student achievement by increasing
student access to information, supporting teacher effectiveness, and facilitating the administration of student
assessments. Effective use of technology can also increase the efficiency of the district's noninstructional operations
and governance.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop, for Board approval, a comprehensive three-year technology plan
based on an assessment of current uses of technology in the district and an identification of future needs. The
Superintendent or designee may appoint an advisory committee consisting of a variety of staff and community
stakeholders to assist with the development of the technology plan.
The plan shall be integrated into the district's vision and goals for student learning and shall contain research-based
strategies and methods for the effective use of technology. When required for state or federal grant programs in
which the district participates, the plan shall also address all components required for receipt of such grants.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that any use of technological resources in the district protects the
private and confidential information of students and employees in accordance with law.
