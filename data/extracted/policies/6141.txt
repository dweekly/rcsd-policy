================================================================================

The Board of Education accepts responsibility for establishing what students should learn. The Board shall adopt a
district curriculum which reflects district philosophy, responds to student needs and abilities, and is consistent with
the requirements of law. Insofar as possible, this curriculum shall also reflect the desires of the community and the
needs of society as a whole.
The Board considers curriculum improvement to be a top priority for the district. Curriculum development and
evaluation will therefore be an ongoing process in the district, routinely supported by planned allocations of
resources and staff time.
The Board may establish a curriculum review cycle for comparing each area of the curriculum against state model
curriculum standards and Board policy.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish procedures which ensure that the curriculum development and
evaluation process includes input from teachers, administrators, students and parents/guardians from all grade levels,
disciplines, schools, special programs and categories of students. The selection and evaluation of instructional
materials shall be coordinated with the curriculum development and evaluation process.
The Superintendent or designee shall keep the Board informed about student interest and achievement in each area
of the curriculum. The Superintendent or designee also shall facilitate the Board's efforts to discuss its findings with
district staff and students before adopting the district curriculum.
