The Governing Board recognizes that parents/guardians and community members may wish to organize
parent organizations for the purpose of supporting the district's educational and extracurricular programs. 
The Board appreciates the contributions made by such organizations toward the Board's vision for student
learning and for providing all district students with high-quality educational opportunities.
Persons proposing to establish a school-connected organization shall submit a request to the Board for
authorization to operate within the district or at a district school.
A school-connected organization, including a booster club, parent-teacher association or organization, or
other organization that does not include an associated student body or other student organization, shall be
established and maintained as a separate entity from the school or district. Each school-connected
organization shall be subject to its own bylaws and operational procedures or to the rules or bylaws of its
affiliated state or national organization, as applicable.
In addition, activities by school-connected organizations shall be conducted in accordance with law, Board
policies, administrative regulations, and any rules of the sponsoring school.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish appropriate rules for the relationship between school-
connected organizations and the district.
A school-connected organization shall obtain the written approval of the Superintendent or designee prior to
soliciting funds upon the representation that the funds will be used wholly or in part for the benefit of a
district school or the students at that school. (Education Code 51521)
Any participation in fundraising activities by students and their parents/guardians and/or any donation of
funds or property shall be voluntary. (Education Code 49011)
