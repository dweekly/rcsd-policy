================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that private industry and the schools have a mutual interest in maximizing
student achievement in order to prepare students to be productive citizens and contribute to the economic health of
the community. The Board shall encourage local business involvement in efforts that support the core mission and
goals of the district and promote the academic, social, and physical well-being of students.
Businesses and industry and/or their representatives may support district schools and programs by:
1. Volunteering in the classroom or school, providing special instructional programs or assemblies, and serving as
tutors or mentors for individual students
 
2. Donating funds, products, instructional materials, or services that serve an educational purpose
 
3. Purchasing advertisements in school-sponsored publications or on school property in accordance with law and
Board policy
 
4. Serving on advisory committees in order to provide business expertise or perspectives
 
5. Engaging in other activities approved by the Superintendent or designee that are designed to increase student
learning or support school operations
The Board urges employers to further support the schools by recognizing their employees' needs as
parents/guardians, accommodating their needs for child care, and supporting their involvement with their children's
schools.
The Superintendent or designee may publicly acknowledge the support of a business partner in district
communications and/or by allowing the use of the business name or logo on donated products or materials, but shall
not unduly promote or endorse any commercial activity or products. He/she also may recommend Board
commendation to those individuals and/or businesses that have made extraordinary contributions to the district.
