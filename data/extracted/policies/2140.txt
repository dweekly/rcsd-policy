================================================================================

The Board of Education shall annually conduct a formal evaluation of the Superintendent's performance in order to
assess his/her effectiveness in leading the district toward established goals.
The Board and Superintendent shall establish an appropriate schedule for the annual evaluation process.
Evaluation criteria shall be based on district goals and success indicators agreed upon by the Board and
Superintendent prior to the evaluation. The evaluation shall provide commendations in areas of strength, provide
recommendations for improving effectiveness, and serve as a basis for making decisions about salary increases
and/or contract extension.
The Board and Superintendent shall annually consider what evaluation method(s) will best serve the district and
agree on the specific written instrument to be used.
Prior to the evaluation, the Superintendent shall be responsible for preparing and distributing to the Board for its
review a report of progress toward district goals, the Superintendent's self-appraisal of accomplishments and
performance, and a review of action taken to address any Board recommendations from the previous evaluation. The
Board shall also review the Superintendent's current contract and any relevant Board policies.
Each Board member shall independently evaluate the Superintendent's performance. The Board shall determine who
will summarize and combine the individual evaluations to create a consensus document and how that consensus
document will be formatted. The evaluation shall be a composite of individual Board members' opinions, but there
shall be only one final evaluation representing the Board's collective judgment. This final evaluation shall be provided
to the Superintendent for his/her response.
The Board shall meet in closed session with the Superintendent to discuss the evaluation. (Government Code 54957)
The Superintendent shall have an opportunity to ask questions, respond verbally and in writing to the evaluation, and
present additional evidence of his/her performance or district progress.
The Board president and Superintendent shall sign the evaluation as evidence that the evaluation has been
discussed. The Superintendent shall place the evaluation in his/her personnel file.
After each evaluation has been completed, the Board shall meet in open session to give the Board and
Superintendent an opportunity to jointly identify performance goals for the next year.
