Classified Personnel
The Governing Board desires to employ and retain highly qualified classified personnel to support the district's educational
program and operations. Newly hired classified employees shall serve a probationary period during which the Board shall
determine their suitability for long-term district employment.
A probationary employee who has been employed by the district for six months or 130 days of paid service, whichever is
longer, shall be classified as a permanent employee of the district. (Education Code 45113, 45301)
However, in order to receive permanent classified service status, a full-time district police officer or public safety dispatcher
who operates a dispatch center certified by the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training shall serve in a
probationary status for not less than one year from the date of appointment. (Education Code 45113, 45301)
Probationary employees shall receive written performance evaluations by their supervisor during the probationary period.
These evaluations shall indicate whether the evaluator is satisfied or not satisfied with the employee's ability, performance,
and compatibility with the job.
The district may, without cause, dismiss a new employee during the probationary period.
Permanent employees promoted to a higher classification shall be considered probationary in their new position until they
have satisfactorily completed the probationary period.
A permanent employee who accepts a promotion and fails to complete the probationary period for that promotional position
shall be employed in the classification from which the employee was promoted. (Education Code 45113, 45301)
This policy shall be made available to classified employees and the public. (Education Code 45113)
