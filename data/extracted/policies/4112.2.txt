================================================================================

The Governing Board recognizes that the district's ability to provide a high-quality educational program is dependent upon
the employment of certificated staff who are adequately prepared and have demonstrated proficiency in basic skills and in
the subject matter to be taught. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that persons employed in positions requiring
certification qualifications possess the appropriate credential permit, or other certification document from the Commission on
Teacher Credentialing (CTC) and fulfill any additional state, federal, or district requirements for the position.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide assistance and support to teachers holding preliminary credentials to enable
them to meet the qualifications required for the clear credential.
Priorities for Hiring Based on Unavailability of Credentialed Teacher
The Superintendent or designee shall make reasonable efforts to recruit a fully prepared teacher who is authorized in the
subject or setting for each assignment or, when necessary, a fully prepared teacher serving on a local assignment option.
Whenever a teacher with a clear or preliminary credential is not available, the Superintendent or designee shall make
reasonable efforts to recruit an individual for the assignment in the following order: (Education Code 44225.7)
1. A candidate who enrolls in an approved intern program in the region of the district and possesses an intern
credential
 
2. A candidate who is scheduled to complete preliminary credential requirements within six months and who is granted a
provisional internship permit (PIP) or short-term staff permit issued by the CTC
The Board shall approve, as an action item at an open Board meeting, a notice of its intent to employ a PIP applicant
for a specific position. (5 CCR 80021.1)
 
3. An individual who has been granted a credential waiver by the CTC
Prior to requesting that the CTC issue an emergency permit or a limited assignment permit, the Board shall annually approve
a Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators. The Declaration of Need shall be approved by the Board as an action
item at a regularly scheduled open Board meeting, with the entire Declaration of Need being included in the Board agenda.
(Education Code 44225, 44225.7; 5 CCR 80023.2, 80026, 80027, 80027.1)
The Declaration of Need shall certify that there is an insufficient number of certificated persons who meet the district's
specified employment criteria for the position(s) and that the district has made reasonable efforts to recruit individuals who
meet the qualifications specified in items #1-2 above. The Declaration of Need shall also indicate the number and type of
emergency permits that the district estimates it will need during the valid period of the Declaration of Need, based on the
previous year's actual needs and projections of enrollment. Whenever the actual number of permits needed exceeds the
estimate by 10 percent, the Board shall revise and resubmit the Declaration of Need. (5 CCR 80026)
Whenever it is necessary to employ noncredentialed teachers to fill a position requiring certification qualifications, the
Superintendent or designee shall provide support and guidance in accordance with law to ensure the quality of the
instructional program.
National Board for Professional Teaching Standards Certification
The Superintendent or designee shall promote a career continuum that includes participation of district teachers in
professional learning that supports their completion of advanced certification awarded by the National Board for Professional
Teaching Standards (NBPTS). The Superintendent or designee may coordinate a cohort of teachers through school or district
programs or other available networks.
With Board approval and funding, and consistent with the collective bargaining agreement and applicable law, the
Superintendent may provide an incentive program for teacher participation in NBPTS certification, which may include:
1. Defraying, subsidizing, or reimbursing the registration, certification, or maintenance fees for NBPTS
certification
 
2. Providing bonuses, step increases, or differential pay for teachers who maintain their certification and continue to

teach in the district, with priority given to teachers at Title I schools and schools serving a majority of low-income
students
 
3. Providing substitute teachers to provide release time for participating teachers
 
4. Providing stipends for teacher participation that match other professional development stipends
 
5. Compensating mentor teachers who support other teachers' professional learning aligned to NBPTS standards
Parental Notifications
At the beginning of each school year, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the parents/guardians of each student
attending a school receiving Title I funds that they may request information regarding the professional qualifications of their
child's classroom teacher including, but not limited to, whether the teacher: (20 USC 6312)
1. Has met state qualification and licensing criteria for the grade levels and subject areas in which the teacher
provides instruction
 
2. Is teaching under emergency or other provisional status through which state qualification or licensing criteria have
been waived
 
3. Is teaching in the field of discipline of the teacher's certification
In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians in a timely manner whenever their child has been
assigned, or has been taught for four or more consecutive weeks by, a teacher who does not meet applicable state
certification or licensure requirements at the grade level and subject area to which the teacher has been assigned. (20 USC
6312)
