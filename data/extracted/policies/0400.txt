================================================================================

The Board of Education believes that careful planning is essential to effective implementation of district programs
and policies. Comprehensive plans shall identify cohesive strategies for school improvement and provide stability in
district operations.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop comprehensive plans for the implementation of the district's vision
and goals, on specific policy topics and on other areas as required by law. As appropriate, comprehensive plans may
describe, but not be limited to, anticipated short- and long-term needs, measurable outcomes, priorities, activities,
available resources, timelines, staff responsibilities, and strategies for internal and external communications regarding
the plan.
Comprehensive plans are subject to review and approval by the Board.
The process for developing comprehensive plans shall invite broad participation of school and community
representatives. Committees may be appointed to assist in the development of plans. Comprehensive plans shall be
available to the public and shall be reviewed at regular intervals as specified within the plan.
In addition, school-level plans may be developed to meet the unique circumstances of individual school sites
provided that they are consistent with law, district vision, Board policies, administrative regulations and districtwide
plans. School plans may be subject to review and approval of the Superintendent or designee and/or the Board.
