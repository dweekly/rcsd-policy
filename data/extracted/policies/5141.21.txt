The Governing Board believes that regular school attendance is critical to student learning and that students who need to
take medication prescribed or ordered for them by their authorized health care providers should be able to participate in the
educational program.
Any medication prescribed for a student with a disability who is qualified to receive services under the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 shall be administered in accordance with the
student's individualized education program or Section 504 services plan, as applicable.
For the administration of medication to other students during school or school-related activities, the Superintendent or
designee shall develop protocols which shall include options for allowing parents/guardians to administer medication to their
child at school, designate other individuals to do so on their behalf, and, with the student's authorized health care provider's
approval, request the district's permission for the student to self-administer a medication or self-monitor and/or self-test for a
medical condition. Such processes shall be implemented in a manner that preserves campus security, minimizes instructional
interruptions, and promotes student safety and privacy.
The Superintendent or designee shall make epinephrine auto-injectors available at each school for providing emergency
medical aid to any person suffering, or reasonably believed to be suffering, from an anaphylactic reaction. (Education Code
49414)
The Superintendent or designee shall make naloxone hydrochloride or another opioid antagonist available for emergency
medical aid to any person suffering, or reasonably believed to be suffering, from an opioid overdose. (Education Code
49414.3)
The Board fully supports the provision of medical care for students, as needed, and recognizes that some students may
require the administration of medicinal cannabis for their medical care. Because of the conflict between state and federal law
regarding the legality of medicinal cannabis, the Board cannot allow the administration of medicinal cannabis to students on
school grounds by parents/guardians or school personnel. Administration of medicinal cannabis will need to occur off of
school grounds.
The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with city and county emergency responders, including local public health
administrators, to design procedures or measures for addressing an emergency such as a public disaster or epidemic.
Administration of Medication by School Personnel
When allowed by law, medication prescribed to a student by an authorized health care provider may be administered by a
school nurse or, when a school nurse or other medically licensed person is unavailable and the physician has authorized
administration of medication by unlicensed personnel for a particular student, by other designated school personnel with
appropriate training. School nurses and other designated school personnel shall administer medications to students in
accordance with law, Board policy, administrative regulation, and, as applicable, the written statement provided by the
student's parent/guardian and authorized health care provider. Such personnel shall be afforded appropriate liability
protection.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that school personnel designated to administer any medication receive
appropriate training and, as necessary, retraining from qualified medical personnel before any medication is administered. At a
minimum, the training shall cover how and when such medication should be administered, the recognition of symptoms and
treatment, emergency follow-up procedures, and the proper documentation and storage of medication. Such trained,
unlicensed designated school personnel shall be supervised by, and provided with immediate communication access to, a
school nurse, physician, or other appropriate individual.
The Superintendent or designee shall maintain documentation of the training and ongoing supervision, as well as annual
written verification of competency of other designated school personnel.
