The Board of Education believes students should be assigned to classes and/or grouped in a manner that provides
the most effective learning environment for all students.
When assigning students to specific classes, the principal or designee may consider the following criteria:
1. Staff recommendation, including, but not limited to, the recommendations of teachers and counselors
 
2. Skills and classroom management style of individual teachers
 
3. Student skill level as indicated by achievement and testing data
 
4. Balance of high, medium, and low academic achievers
 
5. Student interests, readiness, behavior, and motivation
 
6. Student/teacher ratios and, if relevant, class size reduction considerations
The principal or designee may accept from parents/guardians any information which would be helpful in making
placement decisions. However, a parent/guardian who provides such information shall be informed that a request for
a specific teacher shall be one of many factors which may be taken into account when determining his/her child's
placement. Parents with additional concerns may follow district complaint procedures.
During the school year, the principal or designee may make any adjustments in class placement which he/she
considers beneficial to the student or the educational program.
