The Board of Education desires students and staff to be free from the danger presented by firearms and other
weapons and recognizes that they have the right to a safe and secure campus free from psychological and physical
harm.
Possession of Weapons
The Board prohibits any person other than authorized law enforcement from possessing weapons, imitation firearms,
or dangerous instruments of any kind in school buildings, on school grounds or buses, at school-related or school-
sponsored activities away from school, or while going to or coming from school.
Unless he/she has obtained prior written permission as specified below, any student who is determined to have
brought a firearm to school or possessed a firearm at school, as verified by a school employee, shall be expelled for
not less than one year, except that the Board may set an earlier date for readmission on a case-by-case basis, in
accordance with Board policy and administrative regulation. (Education Code 48915; 20 USC 7151)
Students possessing or threatening others with any weapon, dangerous instrument, or imitation firearm are subject
to suspension and/or expulsion in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulations.
Under the power granted to the Board to maintain order and discipline in the schools and to protect the safety of
students, staff, and the public, any school employee is authorized to confiscate a weapon, dangerous instrument, or
imitation firearm from any person on school grounds.
The principal or designee shall notify law enforcement authorities when any student possesses a weapon without
permission or commits any act of assault with a firearm or other weapon. (Education Code 48902; Penal Code 245,
626.9, 626.10; 20 USC 7151)
Advance Permission for Possession of a Firearm for Educational Use
A student who desires to possess or transport an imitation firearm on school grounds for an educational purpose
shall request prior permission from the principal at least five school days in advance of the planned possession. The
student's parent/guardian shall provide written permission explaining the planned use of the weapon and the
duration. The student shall also submit a written explanation from the staff person responsible for the school-
sponsored activity or class.
On a case-by-case basis, the principal shall determine whether to grant permission for such possession when
necessary for a school-sponsored activity or class or as part of the educational program. Factors that shall be
considered include, but are not limited to, the planned use of the weapon, the duration and location of the planned
use, whether an audience is expected, and any perceived adverse effects to the safety and well-being of students or
staff. If the principal grants such permission, he/she shall provide the student and staff person with a written
explanation regarding any limitations and the permissible duration of the student's possession.
The principal and/or a staff member with knowledge of firearm safety shall inspect the weapon to ensure that
necessary safety precautions have been taken, including inspection to ensure that no live ammunition is present. The
firearm shall be stored in a locked vehicle or in an appropriate, locked container before and after the educational
activity.
A student granted permission to possess a firearm may be suspended and/or expelled if he/she possesses or uses
the weapon inappropriately.
Possession of Pepper Spray
To prevent potential misuse that may harm students or staff, students are prohibited from carrying tear gas or tear
gas weapons such as pepper spray on campus or at school activities.
Reporting of Dangerous Objects
The Board encourages students to promptly report the presence of weapons, injurious objects, or other suspicious
activity to school authorities. The identity of a student who reports such activity shall remain confidential to the
extent permitted by law.

Policy Reference Disclaimer:
The Superintendent or designee shall develop strategies designed to facilitate student reporting of the presence of
injurious objects on school grounds, such as tip hotlines, electronic transmissions, or other methods that preserve the
student's anonymity. Incident reports and records shall not identify the student who reported the possession. The
strategy shall also provide a method of informing staff, students, and parents/guardians that students who report the
presence of injurious objects on school campuses are to be protected and their identity shielded.
