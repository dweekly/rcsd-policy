The Board of Education desires to ensure that district-provided transportation is safe for students, staff, and the
public. To that end, the Superintendent or designee shall establish a drug and alcohol testing program for all district
drivers and other employees who hold a commercial driver's license which is necessary to perform duties related to
their employment with the district. This program shall be designed to fulfill the requirements of state and federal law.
The district's testing program shall include pre-employment drug testing and reasonable suspicion, random, post-
accident, return-to-duty, and follow-up drug and alcohol testing of drivers. (49 USC 31306)
The Superintendent or designee shall contract for testing services and shall ensure that testing contractors and
procedures are certified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to conduct drug specimen analysis
and to conform to the requirements of federal law.
No driver may operate a district vehicle when his/her blood alcohol content is found to be .01 percent or greater. A
driver shall not consume alcohol while on duty or for four hours prior to on-duty time and up to eight hours following
an accident or until he/she undergoes a post-accident test, whichever occurs first. A driver shall not report for duty
or remain on duty that requires performing safety-sensitive functions when the driver uses a controlled substance,
unless so instructed by a physician. (49 CFR 382.205, 382.207, 382.209; Vehicle Code 34520.3; 13 CCR 1213.1)
Any driver who tests positive for alcohol or drugs or who refuses to submit to a test shall be removed from safety-
sensitive functions and may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal in accordance with law,
administrative regulations, and the district's collective bargaining agreement.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that each driver receives an explanation of the federal regulations and
the district's policy and procedure in accordance with law. In addition, each driver shall sign a statement certifying
that he/she has received a copy of the above materials. Representatives of employee organizations shall be notified
of the availability of this information. (49 CFR 382.601)
