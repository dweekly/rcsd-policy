The Governing Board desires to provide enrollment options that meet the diverse needs and interests of district
students and parents/guardians, while also maximizing the efficient use of district facilities. The Superintendent or
designee shall establish procedures for the selection and transfer of students among district schools in accordance
with law, Board policy and administrative regulation. 
The parents/guardians of any student who resides within district boundaries may apply to enroll their child in their
assigned neighborhood school based on their address. Families may also participate in the School of Choice process
to apply for an intradistrict transfer to any other District program or school.
The district has a long standing School of Choice and transfer process outlined below.
The District has three pathways to accommodate student interests and choice. 
1. Students may enroll and remain at their neighborhood school
2. Students may enroll in their neighborhood school and apply to transfer to another neighborhood school.
3. School of Choice: Students may enroll in their neighborhood school and request a transfer to a different non
boundary program or school.
Once accepted to a particular non-boundary School of Choice, a student will be expected to attend for
the length of that non-boundary School of Choice program.
 
If a student chooses to leave that non-boundary School of Choice program early, they may enroll and go
back to their Neighborhood School.
 
Students who have attended a non-boundary program or school may not subsequently enroll in another
non-boundary school, unless approved by the Superintendent.
 
This provision does not apply to transfers to the non boundary middle school.
The Board shall annually review this policy. (Education Code 35160.5, 48980)
Enrollment Priorities
No student currently residing within a school's attendance area shall be displaced by another student transferring
from outside the attendance area. (Education Code 35160.5)
The Superintendent or designee shall grant priority for the enrollment of a student in a district school outside of the
student’s attendance area, if the student:
1. Is enrolled in a district school designated by the California Department of Education (CDE) as "persistently
dangerous" (20 USC 7912; 5 CCR 11992)
 
2. Is a victim of a violent crime while on school grounds (20 USC 7912)
 
3. Is a victim of an act of bullying committed by another district student, as determined through an investigation
following the parent/guardian's submission a written complaint with the school, district, or local law
enforcement agency pursuant to Education Code 234.1 (Education Code 46600)
If the district school requested by the student is at maximum capacity, the Superintendent or designee shall
accept an intradistrict transfer request for another district school. (Education Code 46600)
 
4. Is currently enrolled in a district school identified by CDE for comprehensive support and improvement, with
priority given to the lowest academically achieving students from low-income families as determined pursuant
to 20 USC6313(a)(3)(20 USC 6311)
 
5. Is experiencing special circumstances that might be harmful or dangerous to the student in the current



attendance area, including, but not limited to, threats of bodily harm or threats to the emotional stability of the
student. Any such student may transfer to a district school that is at capacity and otherwise closed to transfers.
To grant priority under these circumstances, the Superintendent or designee must have received
either: (Education Code 35160.5)
 
a. A written statement from a representative of an appropriate state or local agency, including, but not
necessarily limited to, a law enforcement official or a social worker, or a properly licensed or registered
professional, including, but not necessarily limited to, a psychiatrist, psychologist, marriage and family
therapist, clinical social worker, or professional clinical counselor
 
b. A court order, including a temporary restraining order and injunction
 
6. Is a sibling of another student already attending that school
 
7. Has a parent/guardian whose primary place of employment is that school
Application and Selection Process
In order to ensure that priorities for enrollment in district schools are implemented in accordance with law,
applications for intradistrict open enrollment shall be submitted within the enrollment window of the school year
preceding the school year for which the transfer is requested.
The Superintendent or designee shall calculate each school's capacity in a nonarbitrary manner using student
enrollment and available space. (Education Code 35160.5)
Except for the enrollment priorities listed above, the Superintendent or designee shall use a computerized, random,
unbiased selection process during the first window, which takes place during the fall of the previous school year, to
determine who shall be admitted whenever a district school receives admission requests that are in excess of the
school's capacity. (Education Code 35160.5). During the second window in the spring of the previous school year,
students shall be placed on a first come, first served basis depending on availability of open seats.
Enrollment decisions shall not be based on a student’s academic or athletic performance. However, existing entrance
criteria may be used for enrolling students in specialized schools or programs provided that the criteria are uniformly
applied to all applicants. Academic performance may be used to determine eligibility for, or placement in, programs
for gifted and talented students. (Education Code 35160.5)
Transportation
In general, the district shall not be obligated to provide transportation for students who attend school outside their
attendance area. However, upon parent/guardian request, the district shall provide transportation assistance to any
student who is eligible for free or reduced-price meals and may provide transportation assistance to those enrolled in
a district school outside the student's attendance area is a result of being a​ “victim of an act of bullying” or having an
“active military duty parent”. (Education Code 46600)
