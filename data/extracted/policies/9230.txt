Board Candidate Orientation
The Board of Education desires to provide Board candidates with orientation that will enable them to understand the
responsibilities of Board membership. The Superintendent or designee shall provide all candidates with general
information about school programs, district operations, and Board responsibilities.
The Board encourages all candidates to attend public Board meetings during the period of their candidacy.
Candidates have the same access as members of the public to district staff and information.
New Board Member Orientation
The Board and the Superintendent or designee shall help each new member-elect to understand district operations
and the Board's functions, policies and procedures as soon after election as possible. Incoming members shall be
given a copy of the Brown Act and informed that they must conform to its requirements as if they had already
assumed office. Incoming members shall also receive the district's policy manual and other materials related to the
school system and Board member responsibilities.
Incoming members are encouraged to attend Board meetings and meet with the Superintendent or designee and
Board president regarding their role and responsibilities. They also may, at district expense if the district budget
allows, attend workshops for newly elected members.
