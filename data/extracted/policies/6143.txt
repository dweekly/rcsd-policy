The Board of Education recognizes that a well-articulated sequence of courses fosters academic progress and
provides for the best possible use of instructional time. The district's course of study shall provide students with
opportunities to attain the skills, knowledge, and abilities they need to be successful in high school and beyond.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish processes for ensuring the articulation of courses across grade levels
within the district and, as necessary, shall work with representatives of appropriate area districts to ensure
articulation of courses between elementary and secondary schools.
Elementary Grades
The Board shall adopt a course of study for elementary grades that sufficiently prepares students for the secondary
school course of study.
Secondary Grades
The district shall offer all otherwise qualified students in secondary grades a course of study that, upon promotion
from 8th grade, prepares them to meet the requirements and prerequisites for taking A-G required courses in local
high schools. (Education Code 51228)
