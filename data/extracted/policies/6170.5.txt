================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that in order to move into elementary school successfully, students need to feel
secure, ready to learn, supported by their families and welcomed to their new setting. Young children need physical,
social, emotional and intellectual skills to enable them to learn. Therefore, in order to ensure successful transitions to
kindergarten, the Board encourages strong working partnerships among district staff, preschools, families and
community organizations to promote development of these skills.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop strategies to ensure the use of consistent, effective practices to
support all students making the transition to kindergarten.
