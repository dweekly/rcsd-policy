The Board of Education encourages the enrollment and appropriate placement of all school-aged children in school.
The Superintendent or designee shall inform parents/guardians of children entering and/or seeking admission to a
district school at any grade level about admission requirements and shall assist them with enrollment procedures.
The Superintendent or designee shall announce and publicize the timeline and process for registration of students at
district schools. Applications for intradistrict or interdistrict enrollment shall be subject to the timelines specified in
applicable Board policies and administrative regulations.
All appropriate staff shall receive training on district admission policies and procedures, including information
regarding the types of documentation that can and cannot be requested.
The district's enrollment application shall include information about the health care options and enrollment
assistance available to families within the district. The district shall not discriminate against any child for not having
health care coverage and shall not use any information relating to a child's health care coverage or their interest in
learning about health care coverage in any manner that would harm the child or their family. (Education Code
49452.9)
Verification of Admission Eligibility
Before enrolling any child in a district school, the Superintendent or designee shall verify the child's age, residency,
immunization, and other applicable eligibility criteria specified in law, the accompanying administrative regulation, or
other applicable Board policy or administrative regulation.
The district shall not inquire into or request documentation of a student's social security number or the last four
digits of the social security number or the citizenship or immigration status of the student or their family members.
(Education Code 234.7, 49076.7)
However, such information may be collected when required by state or federal law or to comply with requirements
for special state or federal programs. In any such situation, the information shall be collected separately from the
school enrollment process and the Superintendent or designee shall explain the limited purpose for which the
information is collected. Enrollment in a district school shall not be denied on the basis of any such information of the
student or their parents/guardians obtained by the district, or the student's or parent/guardian's refusal to provide
such information to the district.
School registration information shall list all possible means of documenting a child's age for grades K-1 as authorized
by Education Code 48002 or otherwise prescribed by the Board. Any alternative document allowed by the district
shall be one that all persons can obtain regardless of immigration status, citizenship status, or national origin and shall
not reveal information related to citizenship or immigrant status.
The Superintendent or designee shall immediately enroll a homeless student, foster youth, student who has had
contact with the juvenile justice system, or a child of a military family regardless of outstanding fees or fines owed to
the student's last school, lack of clothing normally required by the school, such as school uniforms, or for their
inability to produce previous academic, medical, or other records normally required for enrollment. (Education Code
48645.5, 48850, 48852.7, 48853.5, 49701; 42 USC 11432)
