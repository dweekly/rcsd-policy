The Board of Education may appoint any of its members to serve as its representatives on district committees or
advisory committees of other public agencies or organizations. Due to open meeting law requirements, a majority of
the Board shall not be appointed to serve on the same committee.
When making such appointments, the Board shall clearly specify, on a case-by-case basis, what authority and
responsibilities are involved. Board representatives shall not grant district support or endorsement for any activity
without prior Board approval.
If a committee discusses a topic on which the Board has taken a position, the Board member may express that
position as a representative of the Board. When contributing individual ideas or opinions on other topics, he/she
shall make it clear that he/she is speaking as an individual, not on behalf of the Board.
At its annual organizational meeting, the Board shall designate one Board member as its representative to elect
members to the county committee on school district organization. (Education Code 35023)
The Board shall provide the representative with nominees to this committee.
A Board member is eligible to serve as a member of the county committee on school district organization. (Education
Code 4007)
