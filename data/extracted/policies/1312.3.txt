and federal laws and regulations governing educational programs. The Board encourages early resolution of
complaints whenever possible. To resolve complaints which may require a more formal process, the Board
adopts the uniform system of complaint processes specified in 5 CCR 4600-4670 and the accompanying
administrative regulation.

those programs or activities funded directly by or that receive or benefit from any state financial
assistance, based on the person's actual or perceived characteristics of race or ethnicity, color,
ancestry, nationality, national origin, immigration status, ethnic group identification, age, religion,
marital status, pregnancy, parental status, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sex, sexual
orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, or genetic information, or any other
characteristic identified in Education Code 200 or 220, Government Code 11135, or Penal Code
422.55, or based on the person's association with a person or group with one or more of these actual

and/or state categorical funding (Education Code 64001)
 
18. School safety plans (Education Code 32280-32289)

21. Any complaint alleging retaliation against a complainant or other participant in the complaint process or
anyone who has acted to uncover or report a violation subject to this policy
 
22. Any other state or federal educational program the Superintendent of Public Instruction or designee
deems appropriate
The Board recognizes that alternative dispute resolution (ADR) can, depending on the nature of the
allegations, offer a process to reach a resolution to the complaint that is acceptable to all parties. ADR such
as mediation may be offered to resolve complaints that involve more than one student and no adult. 
However, mediation shall not be offered or used to resolve any complaint involving sexual assault or where
there is a reasonable risk that a party to the mediation would feel compelled to participate. The
Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the use of ADR is consistent with state and federal laws and
regulations.
The district shall protect all complainants from retaliation. In investigating complaints, the confidentiality of
the parties involved shall be protected as required by law. For any complaint alleging retaliation or unlawful
discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment, intimidation,
or bullying), the Superintendent or designee shall keep the identity of the complainant, and/or the subject of
the complaint if different from the complainant, confidential when appropriate, and as long as the integrity of
the complaint process is maintained.
When an allegation that is not subject to UCP is included in a UCP complaint, the district shall refer the non-
UCP allegation to the appropriate staff or agency and shall investigate and, if appropriate, resolve the UCP-
related allegation(s) through the district's UCP.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide training to district staff to ensure awareness and knowledge of
current law and requirements related to UCP, including the steps and timelines specified in this policy and
the accompanying administrative regulation.
The Superintendent or designee shall maintain a record of each complaint and subsequent related actions,
including steps taken during the investigation and all information required for compliance with 5 CCR 4631
and 4633.
Non-UCP Complaints
The following complaints shall not be subject to the district's UCP but shall be investigated and resolved by
the specified agency or through an alternative process:
1. Any complaint alleging child abuse or neglect shall be referred to the County Department of Social Services,
Protective Services Division, or the appropriate law enforcement agency. (5 CCR 4611)

Uniform Complaint Procedures.

facilities conditions that pose a threat to the health or safety of students or staff, teacher vacancies and
