The Board of Education desires to protect the integrity of student assessment processes in order to obtain an
accurate assessment of student achievement in the district and maintain accountability to the community and state.
Students and staff are expected to maintain a high level of integrity in the completion and handling of student
assessments.
Test Integrity
In the administration of standardized tests, staff shall not:
1. Provide inappropriate test preparation
 
2. Modify test administration procedures, except as allowed by law
 
3. Provide inappropriate assistance to students during test administration
 
4. Change or fill in answers on student answer sheets
 
5. Provide inaccurate data on student header sheets
 
6. Discourage or exclude certain students from taking the test
 
7. Engage in any other practice to artificially raise student scores without actually improving underlying student
achievement
Preparation for State Tests
Staff may prepare students for assessments by providing instruction in the content specified in state and district
academic standards and teaching general test-taking strategies that are designed to improve their performance on
tests included in the Standardized Testing and Reporting program, the California High School Exit Examination, or the
California English Language Development Test. Such strategies may include, but not be limited to, using time
efficiently, understanding directions, placing answers correctly on answer sheets, checking answers, problem-solving
tactics, and exposing students to various test formats.
The Superintendent or designee, principals, and teachers shall not implement any program of specific preparation for
the statewide student assessment program or a particular test used within that program. (Education Code 60611)
Practice tests provided by the publisher of the state achievement test may be used for the limited purpose of
familiarizing students with the use of scanable test booklets or answer sheets and the format of test items. No
alternate or parallel form of the test shall be administered or used. (5 CCR 854)
Staff shall not use released test questions to develop practice tests that mimic or parallel state tests, or for teaching
or drilling students only on the released items.
Investigation and Consequences of Testing Irregularities
Reports of student cheating on assessments shall be submitted to the principal or designee for investigation.
Students found to have cheated on assessments shall be subject to disciplinary procedures in accordance with Board
policy and administrative regulations.
A staff member found to have committed testing irregularities shall be subject to discipline in accordance with law,
where applicable, collective bargaining agreements, Board policy, and administrative regulations.
The Superintendent or designee shall immediately investigate with due diligence any reports of inappropriate test
preparation or other testing irregularities.
If the Superintendent or designee is made aware of a testing irregularity on state assessments, he/she shall report
the irregularity to the California Department of Education.
