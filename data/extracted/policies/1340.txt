================================================================================

The Governing Board recognizes the right of members of the public to have access to public records of the district. 
The Board intends the district to provide any person reasonable access to the public records of the schools and
district during normal business hours and within the requirements of state and federal law.
In response to a public records request, the Superintendent or designee shall make reasonable efforts to locate the
requested records, including, but not limited to, any electronic communication substantively related to the records,
such as email, text messages, instant messages, and other electronic communications, regardless of whether they are
transmitted through a district-provided device or account or through an employee's or Board member's personal
device or account.
The district may charge for copies of public records or other materials requested by individuals or groups, unless they
are using their own personal equipment to reproduce the record. The charge shall be based on actual costs of
duplication, as determined by the Superintendent or designee and as specified in administrative regulation.
In order to help maintain the security of district records, members of the public granted access shall examine records
in the presence of a district staff member.
