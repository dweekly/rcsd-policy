The Board of Education accepts responsibility for adopting a sound budget for each fiscal year which is aligned with
the district's vision, goals, and priorities. The district budget shall guide administrative decisions and actions
throughout the year and shall serve as a tool for monitoring the fiscal health of the district.
The district budget shall show a complete plan and itemized statement of all proposed expenditures and all
estimated revenues for the following fiscal year, together with a comparison of revenues and expenditures for the
current fiscal year. The budget shall also include the appropriations limit and the total annual appropriations.
(Education Code 42122)
Single Budget Adoption Process
The Superintendent or designee shall establish an annual budget development process and calendar in accordance
with the single budget adoption process described in Education Code 42127.
The Superintendent shall oversee the preparation of a proposed district budget for approval by the Board and shall
involve appropriate staff at all levels in the development of budget projections.
The Board encourages public input in the budget development process and shall hold public hearings and meetings in
accordance with law.
The Superintendent or designee may appoint a financial advisory committee composed of members of the
community and staff. The committee shall provide recommendations to the Superintendent during the budget
development process. Duties of the committee shall be clearly defined and communicated to all members.
In order to provide guidance in the development of the budget, the Board shall annually establish budget priorities
based on identified district needs and goals and on realistic projections of available funds. The Board also shall
establish budget assumptions or parameters which may take into consideration the stability of funding sources,
enrollment trends, legal requirements and constraints, anticipated increases and/or decreases in the cost of services
and supplies, use of one-time resources, categorical program requirements, scheduled salary increases, and any other
factors necessary to ensure that the budget is a realistic plan for district revenues and expenditures.
The Board shall establish and maintain a general fund reserve for economic uncertainty of at least 6%.
Prior to adopting the budget, the Board shall conduct a first-tier review, and if necessary a second-tier review, to
ensure that the budget meets standards and criteria adopted by the State Board of Education. (Education Code
33127, 33128, 33129; 5 CCR 15440-15452)
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district budget is clearly presented and effectively
communicated to the Board, staff, and public. He/she may adapt or supplement the state-required budget format as
necessary for these purposes.
Whenever revenues and expenditures change significantly throughout the year, the Superintendent or designee shall
recommend budget amendments to ensure accurate projections of the district's net ending balance. When final
figures for the prior-year budget are available, this information shall be used as soon as possible to update the
current-year budget's beginning balance and projected revenues and expenditures. In addition, budget amendments
shall be submitted for Board approval when the state budget is adopted, collective bargaining agreements are
accepted, district income declines, increased revenues or unanticipated savings are made available to the district,
program proposals are significantly different from those approved during budget adoption, and/or other significant
changes occur that impact budget projections.
