The Board of Education recognizes that school library media centers support the educational program by providing
access to a variety of informational resources.
The Board desires to provide library media centers with up-to-date books, reference materials, and electronic
information resources necessary to promote literacy, support students in achieving academic standards, and
encourage students to become lifelong learners.
School libraries shall be open for use by students and teachers during the school day. (Education Code 18103)
Any school library open outside the school day, such as evenings and/or Saturdays, shall be under the supervision of
a certificated employee. (Education Code 18103)
The district's school libraries may provide: (5 CCR 16040)
1. Library instruction to students that enables them to become proficient users of library resources
 
2. Information to teachers and administrators concerning sources and availability of instructional materials that
will aid in the development of school curriculum, and, in cooperation with classroom teachers, the
development of instructional units and activities using library resources
 
3. Assistance to teachers and students in the evaluation, selection, production, and uses of instructional materials
 
4. A collection of materials and resources that support the curriculum and are appropriate for user needs
 
5. Assistance to teachers, administrators, and other school staff members in becoming knowledgeable about
appropriate uses of library media services, materials, and equipment
The Superintendent or designee shall develop procedures for the selection and evaluation of library materials.
Library Plans
Whenever a school receives state funding for school and library improvement pursuant to Education Code
41570-41573, the school site council shall develop a single plan for student achievement which incorporates a
districtwide plan for school libraries. (Education Code 41572)
In developing the districtwide plan, the Superintendent or designee is encouraged to consult with school library
media teachers, classroom teachers, administrators, parents/guardians, and students as appropriate in the
development of the plan.
The districtwide library plan shall describe the district's vision and goals for the district's libraries and action steps
including how funds will be distributed to school sites. As appropriate, the plan may also address staffing, facilities,
selection and evaluation of materials, prioritization of needs, and other related matters.
Classroom Libraries for Grades K-4
When state funding is available for library materials in grades K-4 classrooms, the Superintendent or designee shall
develop, for certification by the Board, a districtwide classroom library plan grades K-4. The plan shall include a
means of preventing loss, damage, or destruction of the materials. (Education Code 60242, 60422)
The districtwide plan for school libraries developed pursuant to Education Code 41572 may fulfill this requirement
provided the plan meets the criteria of Education Code 60242.
The Superintendent or designee is encouraged to consult with primary grade teachers and school and/or county
office of education library media teachers in the development of the plan and to consider selections from the list of
books recommended by the State Librarian pursuant to Education Code 19336.
Selection and Evaluation of School Library Materials
Responsibility for the selection of library materials is delegated to the professional library staff through the principal.



School librarians shall evaluate materials, using professional selection aids and standards, in accordance with law,
Board policy, and administrative regulation. The selection process shall invite recommendations from administrators,
teachers, other staff, parents/guardians, and students as appropriate.
Library materials should be continually evaluated in relation to evolving curricula, new formats of materials, new
instructional methods, and the needs of students and teachers. Materials that contain obsolete subject matter or are
no longer appropriate shall be removed, and lost or worn materials may be replaced if possible.
Complaints regarding the appropriateness of library materials shall be addressed using the district's procedures for
complaints regarding instructional materials.
Fees
Students shall be allowed to borrow school library materials at no charge for use in the library and classrooms as well
as out of school. (5 CCR 16042)
No charge shall be assessed for the late return of materials.
Reports
The district shall, on or before August 31 each year, report to the California Department of Education on the
condition of school libraries for the preceding year ending June 30. (Education Code 18122)
