The Board of Education recognizes that high-quality preschool experiences help children ages 3-5 years to develop
knowledge, skills, abilities, and attributes necessary for a successful transition into the elementary education
program. Early education programs should provide developmentally appropriate activities in a safe, adequately
supervised, and cognitively rich environment.
Collaboration with Community Programs
The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with the local child care and development planning council, other
public agencies, organizations, the county office of education, and/or private preschool providers to assess the
availability of preschool programs in the community and the extent to which the community's preschool needs are
being met. The Board encourages the development of a comprehensive districtwide and/or countywide plan to
increase children's access to high-quality preschool programs.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide information about preschool options in the community to
parents/guardians upon request.
District Preschool Programs
When the Board determines that it is feasible, the district may contract with the California Department of Education
(CDE) to provide preschool services in facilities at or near district schools.
The Board shall approve for the district's preschool program a written philosophical statement, goals, and objectives
that reflect the cultural and linguistic characteristics of the families to be served and address the program
components specified in 5 CCR 18272-18281 and the accompanying administrative regulation. (5 CCR 18271)
The Board shall set priorities for establishing or expanding services as resources become available, giving
consideration to the benefits of providing early education programs for at-risk children and/or children residing in the
attendance areas of the lowest performing district schools.
On a case-by-case basis, the Board shall determine whether the district shall directly administer a preschool program
or contract with a public or private provider to offer such a program.
Facilities for preschool classrooms shall be addressed in the district's facilities master plan, including an assessment
as to whether adequate and appropriate space exists on school sites. As necessary, the Superintendent or designee
shall provide information to the Board regarding facilities financing options for preschool classrooms and/or facilities
available through partnering organizations or agencies.
Because parents/guardians are essential partners in supporting the development of their children, the
Superintendent or designee shall involve them in program planning.
The Superintendent or designee shall coordinate planning efforts for the district's preschool program, transitional
kindergarten program, and elementary education program to provide a developmental continuum that builds upon
children's growing skills and knowledge.
The district's program shall be aligned with preschool learning foundations and curriculum frameworks developed by
the CDE which identify the knowledge, skills, and competencies that children typically attain as they complete their
first or second year of preschool. The program shall be designed to facilitate children's development in essential skills
related to language and literacy, mathematics, physical development, health, visual and performing arts, science,
history-social science, English language development, and social-emotional development.
The district's preschool program shall provide appropriate services to support the needs of English learners and
children with disabilities.
The district shall encourage volunteerism in the program and shall communicate frequently with parents/guardians of
enrolled children regarding their child's progress.
To maximize the ability of children to succeed in the preschool program, the program shall support children's health
through proper nutrition and physical activity and shall provide or make referrals to available health and social
services as needed.

programs possess the appropriate permit(s) issued by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, meet any additional
qualifications established by the Board, and participate in professional development opportunities designed to

Preschool admissions policies and procedures shall be in writing and available to the public. Such policies and
procedures shall include criteria designating those children whose needs can be met by the program and services, the
ages of children who will be accepted, program activities, any supplementary services provided, any field trip

available child care and development programs in the district or community in order to assist families whose child

The Superintendent or designee shall develop and implement an annual plan of evaluation which conforms to state
requirements. (5 CCR 18279)
