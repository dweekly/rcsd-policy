================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes the right of public school employees to form bargaining units, select an employee
organization as the exclusive representative of their unit, and be represented by that organization in their
employment relationship with the district. The Board is committed to negotiating in good faith with the employee
organizations and respecting the rights of employees and employee organizations.
The Superintendent or designee shall negotiate only with the exclusive representative of each bargaining unit.
(Government Code 3543.3)
Certificated and classified employees shall not be included in the same bargaining unit. (Government Code 3545)
The district shall not dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any employee organization or
contribute financial or other support to it. (Government Code 3543.5)
Neither the district nor the employee organization shall impose or threaten to impose reprisals on employees,
discriminate or threaten to discriminate against employees, or otherwise interfere with, restrain, or coerce
employees because of their membership or nonmembership in an employee organization. (Government Code
3543.5, 3543.6)
Management and Supervisory Employees
Employees serving in a management, senior management, or confidential position shall not be represented by an
exclusive representative. Such employees may represent themselves individually or may be represented by an
employee organization whose membership is composed entirely of employees designated as holding those positions,
but that organization shall not meet and negotiate with the district. (Government Code 3543.4)
However, the district may recognize a bargaining unit of supervisors if that unit includes all supervisory employees
and if the unit does not represent the employee whom the supervisors supervise. (Government Code 3545)
Management, supervisory, and confidential positions shall be classified as follows: (Government Code 3540.1)
1. Management employee means any employee who has significant responsibilities for formulating district
policies or administering district programs, and whose position is designated as a management position by the
Board.
 
2. Supervisory employee means any employee, regardless of job description, having the authority, in the interest
of the district, to hire, transfer, suspend, layoff, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, discipline, assign
work, direct, adjust grievance of other employees, or effectively recommend that action. The exercise of this
authority shall not be merely routine or clerical in nature, but shall require the use of independent judgment.
 
3. Confidential employee means any employee who is required to develop or present management positions with
respect to employer-employee relations or whose duties normally require access to confidential information
that is used to contribute significantly to the development of management positions.
