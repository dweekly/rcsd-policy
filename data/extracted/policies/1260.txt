The Board of Education recognizes the importance of community support of district programs, including voluntary
financial contributions, to assist the district in achieving its goals for student learning.
The Board designates the Superintendent to work cooperatively with the educational foundation in determining the
purposes for which funds may be used to meet the changing needs of the district and its students. The Board
recognizes that an educational foundation is a separate legal entity, independent of the district. However, the
foundation is encouraged to provide regular reports to the Board on the status of its work and to communicate ways
that the district can help support the foundation's activities.
With the consent of the Superintendent or designee, the educational foundation, as appropriate, may use the
district's name, a school's name, or any logo attributable to a school or the district. The district will provide parent
information for the purpose of communication.
The Board supports foundation allocations that serve all district schools equitably.
