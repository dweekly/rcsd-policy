The Board of Education recognizes that student learning is enhanced when students have access to high-quality
textbooks, equipment and other instructional materials for each of the subjects they are studying. To adequately
support the Board-approved curriculum, instructional materials also should be up to date.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop procedures for determining the sufficiency of district instructional
materials in providing accurate, current information and ensuring that students have access to standards-based
materials. When new instructional materials have been chosen in accordance with the district's selection and
evaluation policy, the Board shall make final decisions regarding the original purchase.
These references are not intended to be part of the policy itself, nor do they indicate the basis or authority
for the Governing Board to enact this policy. Instead, they are provided as additional resources for those interested in the subject matter
of the policy.
