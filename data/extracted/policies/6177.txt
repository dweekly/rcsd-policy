================================================================================

The Governing Board recognizes that an extended break from the instructional program may result in significant 
learning loss, especially among disadvantaged and low-achieving students, and desires to provide opportunities for 
students to practice essential skills, make academic progress, and develop social, emotional, and physical needs and 
interests through hands-on engaging learning experiences.
Summer programs offered by the district shall be aligned with the district's local control and accountability plan 
(LCAP), other applicable district and school plans, and the educational program provided during the school year. When 
feasible, summer programs shall blend high-quality academic instruction in core curricular and/or elective subjects with 
recreation, nutrition programs, social and emotional development, and support services that encourage attendance, 
student engagement in learning, and student wellness.
Summer School:
The Superintendent or designee shall establish summer school classes pursuant to Education Code 46120. 
The district's summer school program may be used to provide supplemental instruction to students needing remediation 
and/or enrichment in core academic subjects.
1. 
 
Demonstrate academic deficiencies in core curriculum areas
 
2. 
 
Are in targeted student groups identified in the district's LCAP as needing increased or improved services to 
succeed in the educational program
 
3. 
 
Are in grades transitional kindergarten (TK)-6 and are required to be offered or provided access to Expanded 
Learning Opportunities Programs pursuant to Education Code 46120 and BP/AR 5184.2 - Before/After School 
Programs
 
The remaining openings shall be offered to other district students on a first-come first-served basis. 
Attendance:
Because summer courses cover extensive instructional content in a relatively short time period, students who have more 
than three excused absences or one unexcused absence may not receive credit for their summer session class(es) unless 
they make-up missed work in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.
Rotation of School Sites:
Sites for summer school programs may be rotated in an effort to make summer school programs more accessible to all 
students, regardless of residence or regular attendance area, and accommodate the maintenance needs of district 
schools.
The Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the Board on summer school enrollment in the current year and 



previous year for the program as a whole and disaggregated by grade level, school that the students attend during the 
regular school year, and student population. In addition, the Superintendent or designee may report on the extent to 
which students successfully achieved the outcomes established for the program.
Additional Summer Learning Opportunities:
Districts are prohibited from charging a fee for summer school programs. However, it is permissible for third parties 
that offer a summer school program to charge a fee for such program. CDE's, "Fiscal Management Advisory 22-01, 
Summer School, Third Parties, and Tuition Fees," provides that if a third party that is affiliated with a district charges 
tuition for a summer program, the district should make an individualized inquiry as to the relationship between the 
district and the third party to determine whether the educational activities are being offered by the district. In making 
this determination, districts may consider factors listed in Fiscal Management Advisory 22-01. Districts with questions 
as to whether a fee may be charged for summer school should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education 
Legal Services or district legal counsel. See also BP/AR 3260 - Fees and Charges
The Superintendent or designee may collaborate with parents/guardians, city and county agencies, community 
organizations, child care providers, and/or other interested persons to develop, implement, and build awareness of 
organized activities that support summer learning.
Strategies to support summer learning may include, but are not limited to: 
1. 
 
Providing information to students and parents/guardians about summer reading programs scheduled to be 
conducted by public libraries or community organizations 
 
2. 
 
Collaborating with the local parks and recreation agency and/or community organizations to provide day camps, 
sports programs, or other opportunities for physical education and activity 
 
3. 
 
Encouraging reading in the home, such as providing lists of recommended reading to students and 
parents/guardians, establishing a target number of books or pages, and providing prizes for achievement of 
reading goals 
 
4. 
 
Assigning summer vacation homework in core curricular subject(s) for extra credit 
 
 
5. Conducting occasional, interactive "fun days" during the summer to provide activities related to art, music, 
science, technology, mathematics, environmental science, multicultural education, debate, or other subject
 
6. Arranging opportunities for community service
