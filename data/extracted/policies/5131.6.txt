================================================================================

The Board of Education believes that the use of alcohol or other drugs adversely affects a student's ability to achieve
academic success, is physically and emotionally harmful, and has serious social and legal consequences. The Board
desires to keep district schools free of alcohol and other drugs in order to help prevent violence, promote school
safety and create a well-disciplined environment conducive to learning.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop, implement and evaluate a comprehensive prevention and intervention
program that is coordinated with other school and community-based services and programs. The district's program
shall be scientifically based and designed to prevent or reduce alcohol or other drug use and the possession and
distribution of illegal drugs. It shall include primary prevention activities such as decision-making skills and conflict
management, instruction, referral to a rehabilitation program, enforcement/discipline, activities that promote the
involvement of parents/guardians, coordination with appropriate community agencies and organizations and is
consistent with the district's wellness policy.
The Board and Superintendent shall agree upon performance measures that will be used to monitor and determine
the effectiveness of the district's program in reducing drug and alcohol use. The Superintendent or designee shall
develop and implement an evaluation process that includes ongoing assessment and analysis of objective data
regarding the incidence of drug and alcohol use among district students, including discipline problems, and the
prevalence of risk factors.
The Superintendent or designee shall consult with principals, teachers, other school personnel, students and
parents/guardians when developing the district's program.
The Superintendent or designee shall clearly communicate to all students, staff and parents/guardians the district's
policies, regulations and school rules related to the use of alcohol and other drugs on school campuses or at school
activities. Information about program needs and goals shall be widely distributed in the school community.
Staff should encourage students to participate as responsible partners in efforts to maintain a safe, constructive
school climate.
The Board encourages the establishment of site-level advisory groups to assist in promoting alcohol- and drug-free
schools.
The district's drug education program shall augment county drug education services, if any. District staff shall take
every opportunity to cooperate with county and county office of education staff in planning and implementing
collaborative alcohol and drug prevention programs.
Instruction
The district shall provide science-based preventative instruction which has been proven effective in helping students
avoid the use of alcohol and other drugs.
All instruction and related materials shall consistently state that unlawful use of alcohol or other drugs is wrong and
harmful. Instruction shall not include the concept of responsible use of drugs or alcohol when such use is illegal. (20
USC 7114, 7162; Health and Safety Code 11999.2)
The district shall offer staff development activities for staff who implement the comprehensive drug and alcohol
prevention and intervention program.
Intervention, Referral and Student Assistance Programs
School staff, students and parents/guardians shall be informed about early warning signs which may indicate alcohol
and other drug use and about appropriate agencies offering intervention programs, counseling, referral and other
student assistance programs.
The Board strongly encourages any student who is using alcohol or drugs to discuss the matter with his/her
parent/guardian or with any staff member. Students who disclose their use of alcohol or other drugs when seeking
help from an intervention or recovery program shall not be disciplined for such use.
