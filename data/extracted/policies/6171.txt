In order to improve the academic achievement of students from economically disadvantaged families, the district
shall use federal Title I funds to provide supplementary services that reinforce the core curriculum and assist
students in attaining proficiency on state academic standards and assessments.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide technical assistance and support to any school participating in the Title
I program, including consultation in the development and implementation of school plans and activities. (20 USC
6312)
The district and each school receiving Title I funds shall develop a written parent involvement policy in accordance
with 20 USC 6318.
Local Educational Agency Plan
The Superintendent or designee shall consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other appropriate school
personnel, and parents/guardians of participating students in the development, periodic review, and, as necessary,
the revision of a local educational agency (LEA) plan. The plan and any revisions shall be submitted to the Board of
Education for approval. (20 USC 6312)
The plan shall address the components specified in 20 USC 6312, which describe the assessments, strategies, and
services the district will use to help low-achieving students meet challenging academic standards.
The initial plan shall be submitted to the California Department of Education (CDE) and approved by the State Board
of Education. Subsequent revisions of the plan shall be kept on file in the district.
Comparability of Services
State and local funds used in schools receiving Title I funds shall provide services that, taken as a whole, are at least
comparable to services in schools that are not receiving Title I funds or, if all district schools are receiving Title I
funds, that are substantially comparable in each school. Comparability may be determined on a school-by-school
basis or by grade span. (20 USC 6321)
The LEA shall have written assurances/policies showing comparability of services across district schools. The
assurances shall address the following items: (1) LEA-wide salary schedule; (2) a policy to ensure equivalence among
schools in teachers, administrators, and other staff; and (3) a policy to ensure equivalence among schools in the
provision of curriculum materials and instructional supplies. (20 U.S.C Section 6321[c][2])
The LEA shall develop procedures for compliance and shall maintain records that are updated biennially to
demonstrate compliance and maintain data to support allowable exclusions of funds and/or staff from the
calculations. (20 U.S.C. Section 6321[c][3])
The comparability of services requirement shall not apply to an LEA that does not have more than one school for
each grade span. (20 U.S.C. Section 6321[c][4])
To demonstrate comparability of services among district schools:
1. The Board shall adopt and implement a districtwide salary schedule.
 
2. The ratio of students to teachers, administrators, and other staff at each Title I school shall not exceed 110
percent of the average ratio across non-Title I schools.
 
3. Salary expenditures at each Title I school shall be no less than 90 percent of the average salary expenditure
across non-Title I schools.
 
4. All district schools shall be provided with the same level of base funding per student for curriculum and
instructional materials.
 
5. The Superintendent or designee shall maintain records of the quantity and quality of instructional materials and

equipment at each school.
At the beginning of each school year, the Superintendent or designee shall measure comparability in accordance with
the above criteria and maintain records documenting the district's compliance. If any instances of non comparability
are identified, the Superintendent or designee shall promptly implement adjustments as needed to ensure
comparability.
Program Evaluation
The Board shall use state assessment results and other available measures or indicators to annually determine
whether each participating school is making adequate yearly progress toward ensuring that all students meet the
state's proficient level of achievement on state assessments. (20 USC 6316)
