The Governing Board is committed to enabling all district students to meet state academic achievement
standards. The district shall provide support and assistance to increase student achievement in all district
schools, especially any school that has been identified by the California Department of Education (CDE) as in
need of comprehensive support and improvement (CSI), targeted support and improvement (TSI), or
additional targeted support and improvement (ATSI).
When any school is identified for CSI, TSI, or ATSI, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the school
community, including the principal, teachers, and parent/guardians of students of the school, of the
identification and, if applicable, shall inform the school of the student subgroup(s) which are consistently
underperforming at the school.
School Plan
Upon receiving notification from CDE that a district school has been identified as eligible for CSI, TSI, or
ATSI, the district shall, in partnership with principals, other school leaders, teachers, and parents/guardians,
develop and implement a plan to improve student outcomes at the school. The plan shall: (20 USC 6311)
1. Be based on all state indicators in the California School Dashboard, including student performance
against state-determined long-term goals, except that any school subject to the state's Dashboard
Alternative School Status that has fewer than 100 students may focus on the state indicators that are
more applicable to the nature of its program
2. Be based on a school-level needs assessment
3. Include evidence-based interventions
4. If the school is iden4ﬁed for CSI or ATSI, iden4fy resource inequi4es, which may include a review of
district and school-level budgets, to be addressed through implementation of the plan
The school plan for student achievement developed pursuant to Education Code 64001 may serve as the
school improvement plan required for CSI, TSI, or ATSI, provided that the plan meets the requirements of 20
USC 6311. (Education Code 64001)
The school improvement plan shall be submitted to the Board for approval. (20 USC 6311)
If any district school is identified for CSI, the district's local control and accountability plan shall include
descriptions of how the district provides support to CSI school(s) in developing the CSI plan and how the
district will monitor and evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the CSI plan to support student
and school improvement.
Monitoring and Intervention
The Board and the Superintendent or designee shall regularly review the performance of each school
identified for CSI, TSI, or ATSI.
After two years of implementing the school plan, if any such school has been unsuccessful in improving
student outcomes to a level that exceeds initial eligibility criteria, the district shall identify the problem and
take additional action as necessary.
If a school identified for CSI fails to improve student outcomes within four years to a level that exceeds the
CSI eligibility criteria, it shall be subject to more rigorous interventions that include, but are not limited to,
partnering with an external entity, agency, or individual with demonstrated expertise and capacity to:
1. Conduct a new needs assessment that focuses on systemic factors and conduct a root cause
analysis that iden4ﬁes gaps between current condi4ons and desired condi4ons in student
performance and progress



2. Use the results of the analysis along with stakeholder feedback to develop a new improvement
plan that includes:
a. A prioritized set of evidence-based interventions and strategies
b. A program evaluation component with support to conduct ongoing performance and
progress monitoring
