teachers, school nurses and students. The primary responsibilities of the Wellness Committee shall be to assist with
policy development and implementation and advise the District on health-related issues, activities, policies, and
programs. The Committee shall also assist with identifying processes for evaluating the Wellness Policy, including
evaluation methods, indicators to measure success, and frequency of reports. At the discretion of the Superintendent

guidelines that are consistent with 42 USC 1758, 1766, 1773, 1779, and federal regulations and which support the
objectives of promoting student health. In order to maximize the District's ability to provide nutritious meals and
snacks, all district schools shall participate in available federal school nutrition programs, including the National

gardens, to support the concepts promoted through the nutrition program. Link with school meal programs, other

another during meal or snack times.
Board Policy Manual
Redwood City School District

REWARDS
Food is strongly encouraged to not be used as a reward for a student's academic performance, accomplishment or
classroom behavior. When food is used as a reward it will be done infrequently and ideally after lunch. The District
will emphasize nonfood incentives as alternatives to all school administrators and staff members.
CELEBRATIONS & SPECIAL OCCASIONS
Schools shall limit classroom celebrations that involve food during instructional time to no more than once per
month, including birthdays, holidays and other celebrations. When possible, classroom celebrations should take place
during the last half hour of the school day and adhere to the food allergy and special dietary needs policy. If

FOOD AND BEVERAGE MARKETING IN SCHOOLS
The Board prohibits the marketing and advertising during school hours of any foods or beverages which do not meet
nutritional standards under State and Federal law through posters, flyers, other signage, vending machine fronts,
logos, scoreboards, school supplies, advertisements in school publications, coupon or incentive programs, free
giveaways, or other means.
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
All students shall be provided opportunities to be physically active on a daily basis. Opportunities for moderate to
vigorous physical activity shall be provided through physical education and recess and may also be provided through
school athletic programs, extracurricular programs, before- and after-school programs, summer learning programs,
programs encouraging students to walk or bicycle to and from school, in-class physical activity breaks, and other
structured and unstructured activities.

Establish physical activity as a priority that is to be included in each school day.
Identify and address potential barriers to providing regular physical education and physical activity at each school
site.
Maximize use of existing facilities to promote children being safely active on a daily basis in all types of weather.
Offer a range of activities that meet the needs, interests and abilities of all students and which are enjoyable, playful,
develop basic skills and are not only competitive.
Integrate fitness education and individualized assessment/feedback to help students understand, improve and/or
maintain their physical well-being.
Expand opportunities for students to participate in extracurricular physical activity through clubs, intramural
programs and special events.
SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL
The District encourages parents and students to walk and bike and use public transit to school where safe routes are
available.
In the interest of enhancing the physical wellbeing of Redwood City School District students, the District will work
with school board members, parents/guardians, local pubic works and public safety personnel, and Redwood City
2020 to implement SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL programming in support of walking/biking to school.
NURSING / HEALTH SERVICES
In order to ensure that students have access to comprehensive health services, the district may provide access to
health services at or near district schools and/or may provide referrals to community resources.
SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL CLIMATE
The Board recognizes that a safe, positive school environment is also conducive to students' physical and mental
health and thus prohibits bullying and harassment of all students, including bullying on the basis of body size or
health condition. A positive school climate shall be maintained to ensure all students feel safe, supported, and take

pride in their school. Schools are encouraged to have clear and consistent rules for student conduct with positive
reinforcement for students who adhere to guidelines. Schools will make every effort to incorporate programs that
promote non-violent conflict resolution skills and prevent bullying.
PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
The District is committed to ensuring the safety of each student and staff member. Each school site shall adopt a
school safety plan. The District shall adopt and maintain an Incident Command System (ICS), which is a systematic
tool used for the command, control, and coordination of emergency response designed to deal with incidents of any
size or scope.
As part of the District's coordinated approach to supporting student wellness and safety and enhancing student
learning, the Superintendent or designee shall explore strategies to promote safe routes to school, safe driving, and
pedestrian awareness. The Board recognizes that walking, bicycling, and other forms of active transport to school
promote students' physical activity and reduce vehicle traffic and air pollution in the vicinity of schools.
COUNSELING / PSYCHOLOGICAL / SOCIAL SERVICES
District prevention and intervention services shall support the mental, behavioral, and social-emotional health of
students, promote success in the learning process, and the health of the school environment. Services may include:
direct and indirect interventions to address psychological, academic, and social barriers to learning, such as individual
or group counseling and consultation, and referrals to school and community support services as needed.
EMPLOYEE WELLNESS
Fostering employees' physical and mental health protects district staff, and by doing so, helps to support students'
health and academic success. The District values its staff and their well-being and is committed to providing
education and programs to support staff wellness and encourage staff to serve as positive role models. Professional
development is encouraged that facilitates staff's knowledge, skills, and understanding of health and wellness.
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
The Board may enter into a joint use agreement or memorandum of understanding to make district facilities or
grounds available for recreational or sports activities outside the school day and/or to use community facilities to
expand students' access to opportunity for physical activity.
FAMILY ENGAGEMENT
To encourage consistent health messages between the home and school environment, the Superintendent or
designee may disseminate health information and/or the district's student wellness policy to parents/guardians
through district or school newsletters, handouts, parent/ guardian meetings, district and school web sites, and other
communications. Outreach to parents/guardians shall emphasize the relationship between student health and
academic performance.
FUNDRAISING
School organizations and staff are strongly encouraged to support healthy food options or nonfood items for
fundraising purposes. To support and encourage children's health and school nutrition education efforts, school
fundraising activities should limit the frequency of non-nutritious food items sold; and for carnivals/festivals, schools
are encouraged to balance healthy food items with non-nutritious food offerings. The district will make available a
list of preferable fundraising activities.
IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION
The Superintendent or designee shall assess the implementation and effectiveness of this policy at least every three
years. The assessment shall include the extent to which district schools are in compliance with this policy, the extent
to which this policy compares to model wellness policies, and a description of the progress made in attaining the
goals of the wellness policy. Specific measurable objectives shall be defined to inform the assessment of the
Wellness Policy.
The Superintendent or designee shall invite feedback on district and school wellness activities from Child Nutrition
personnel, school administrators, the Wellness Advisory Council, parents/guardians, students, teachers, before- and
after-school program staff, and other stakeholders.
