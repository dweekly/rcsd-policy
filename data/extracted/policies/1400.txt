================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that agencies at all levels of government share its concern and responsibility for
the health, safety, and welfare of youth. The Board and Superintendent or designee shall initiate and maintain good
working relationships with representatives of these agencies in order to help district schools and students make use
of the resources which governmental agencies can provide.
The district may enter into agreements with other agencies which involve the exchange of funds or reciprocal
services. Such agreements shall be approved by the Board and executed in writing.
Elections/Voter Registration
If a city or county elections official specifically requests the use of a school building as a polling place, the Board shall
allow its use for such purpose. The Board may authorize the use of school buildings as polling places on any election
day, and may also authorize the use of school buildings, without cost, for the storage of voting machines and other
vote-tabulating devices. If school will be in session, the Superintendent or designee shall identify to elections officials
the specific areas of the school buildings not occupied by school activities that will be allowed for use as polling
places. (Elections Code 12283)
When a school is used as a polling place, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the elections official a site
with an adequate amount of space that will allow the precinct board to perform its duties in a manner that will not
impede, interfere, or interrupt the normal process of voting and shall make a telephone line for Internet access
available for use by local elections officials if so requested. He/she shall make a reasonable effort to ensure that the
site is accessible to disabled persons. (Elections Code 12283)
