The Board of Education shall seek reimbursement of damages and rewards from any individual or from the custodial
parent/guardian of any minor who commits any act of theft or vandalism.
Rewards
If law enforcement officials are unable to fix responsibility for the theft or vandalism, the Board may authorize a
reward in any amount it deems appropriate for information leading to the identification and apprehension of the
guilty party.
A reward shall be paid only when the guilt of the person responsible for the crime has been established by a criminal
conviction or other appropriate judicial procedures.
