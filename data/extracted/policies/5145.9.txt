immigration status, ethnic group identification, ethnicity, age, religion, marital status, pregnancy, parental status,
physical or mental disability, medical condition, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, or

prevent incidents of hate-motivated behavior to the extent possible, and address such incidents in a timely manner
when they occur.
