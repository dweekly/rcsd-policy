Monitoring and Intervention
The Board and the Superintendent or designee shall regularly review the performance of each school identified for
CSI, TSI, or ATSI.
After two years of implementing the school plan, if any such school has been unsuccessful in improving student
outcomes to a level that exceeds initial eligibility criteria, the district shall identify the problem and take additional
action as necessary.
If a school identified for CSI fails to improve student outcomes within four years to a level that exceeds the CSI
eligibility criteria, it shall be subject to more rigorous interventions that include, but are not limited to, partnering
with an external entity, agency, or individual with demonstrated expertise and capacity to:
1. Conduct a new needs assessment that focuses on systemic factors and conduct a root cause analysis that
identifies gaps between current conditions and desired conditions in student performance and progress
 
2. Use the results of the analysis along with stakeholder feedback to develop a new improvement plan that
includes:
 a. A prioritized set of evidence-based interventions and strategies
b. A program evaluation component with support to conduct ongoing performance and progress
monitoring
