================================================================================

All district staff shall adhere to the provisions of the federal copyright law and maintain the highest ethical standards
in using copyrighted materials. The district shall provide no legal support to any employee who violates the copyright
law. Willful infringement of this law by students or staff may result in disciplinary action.
The Board of Education recognizes that computer software piracy contributes to higher costs and decreases
commercial incentives for the development of quality educational computer software. In circumstances where the
interpretation of the copyright law is ambiguous, the district shall determine appropriate use of computer software
by referring to the license agreement and/or policy statements contained in the software packages used in the
district. Computer-related instruction for students and staff shall address the ethical and practical problems caused
by software piracy.
The Superintendent or designee shall be the only individual who may sign license agreements for software for district
schools. Each school using licensed software shall have a signed copy of the software agreement.
The Superintendent or designee shall maintain regulations to discourage violation of all copyright laws and prevent
illegal copying activities.
