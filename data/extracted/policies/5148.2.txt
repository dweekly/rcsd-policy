================================================================================

The Board of Education desires to provide before-school and/or after-school enrichment programs that support the
regular education program and provide safe, constructive alternatives for students. In order to increase academic
achievement of participating students, the content of such programs shall be aligned with the district's vision and
goals for student learning, local control and accountability plan, curriculum, and district and state academic standards.
The district's program shall be planned through a collaborative process that includes parents/guardians, students,
representatives of participating schools, governmental agencies including city and county parks and recreation
departments, local law enforcement, community organizations, and, if appropriate, the private sector. (Education
Code 8422, 8482.5)
To the extent feasible, the district shall give priority to establishing before-school and/or after-school programs in
low-performing schools and/or programs that serve low-income and other at-risk students.
The establishment of any program shall be approved by the Board and the principal of each participating school.
(Education Code 8421, 8482.3)
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all staff who directly supervise students in the district's before-
school and/or after-school program possess appropriate knowledge and experience. As needed, staff and volunteers
shall receive ongoing training related to their job responsibilities.
The program shall include academic and enrichment elements in accordance with law and administrative regulation.
In addition, the program may include support services that reinforce the educational component and promote
student health and well-being, including, but not limited to, drug and violence prevention programs,
counseling/guidance services, character education, and programs that promote parent/guardian involvement and
family literacy.
A fee may be charged to participating families based on the actual cost of services, as long as the fee is waived or
reduced for families with students who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals. (Education Code 8422, 8482.6)
The fee may be waived or subsidized based on economic disadvantage or other critical needs in accordance with
Education Code 8263 and 8350.
In regard to the After School Education and Safety program and/or 21st Century Community Learning Center
program, no fee shall be charged for a student identified as a homeless or foster youth. (Education Code 8482.6)
Eligible students ages 11-12 years shall be placed in a before-school or after-school program, if and when available,
rather than subsidized child care and development services. During the time that the before-school or after-school
program does not operate, such students may be provided the option of enrolling in child care and development
services in accordance with the priorities established in AR 5148 - Child Care and Development. (Education Code
8263.4)
The Board and the Superintendent or designee shall monitor student participation rates and shall identify measures
that shall be used to determine program effectiveness, such as outcome-based data on academic performance,
attendance, program self-assessments; feedback from staff, participating students, and parents/guardians; and
observations of program activities, and positive behavioral changes.
Every three years, the Superintendent or designee shall review the after-school program plan, including, but not
limited to, program goals, program content, and outcome measures. Documentation of the program plan shall be
maintained for a minimum of five years.
