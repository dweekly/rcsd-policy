learning and achievement, and employee morale, and desires to provide school facilities that are safe, clean, and
functional, as defined in Education Code 17002.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop a facilities inspection and maintenance program to ensure that district
schools are maintained in good repair in accordance with law. At a minimum, the inspection program shall determine
facility conditions specified on the inspection and evaluation instrument, including any evidence of:
1. Gas leaks
 
2. Problems with mechanical systems, including heating, ventilation, or air conditioning systems

7. Damaged or nonfunctioning structural elements, such as posts, beams, or supports
 
8. Nonfunctioning fire sprinklers and emergency equipment, such as alarms or fire extinguishers
 
9. Improperly secured or nonfunctioning electrical systems, components, or equipment
 
10. Inadequate or nonfunctioning lighting

12. Inaccessible or nonfunctioning drinking fountains

The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that any necessary repairs identified during the inspection are made in a
