The Board of Education recognizes the need to identify and evaluate children with disabilities in order to provide
them with the services required by law.
The district shall provide a free appropriate public education to students who reside within the district and who are
classified as disabled under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Such students shall receive regular
or special education and related aids and services designed to meet their individual educational needs as adequately
as the needs of nondisabled students are met. (34 CFR 104.33)
