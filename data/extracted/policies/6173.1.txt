================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that foster youth may face significant barriers to achieving academic success due
to their family circumstances, disruption to their educational program, and their emotional, social, and other health
needs. To enable such students to achieve state and district academic standards, the Superintendent or designee
shall provide them with full access to the district's educational program and implement strategies identified as
necessary for the improvement of the academic achievement of foster youth in the district's local control and
accountability plan (LCAP).
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that placement decisions for foster youth are based on the students'
best interests as defined in law and administrative regulation. To that end, he/she shall designate a staff person as
the district liaison for foster youth to help facilitate the enrollment, placement, and transfer of foster youth.
The Superintendent or designee and district liaison shall ensure that all appropriate staff, including, but not limited to,
each principal, school registrar, and attendance clerk, receive training on the enrollment, placement, and transfer of
foster youth and other related rights.
The Board desires to provide foster youth with a safe, positive learning environment that is free from discrimination
and harassment and that promotes students' self-esteem and academic achievement. The Superintendent or
designee shall develop strategies to build a foster youth's feeling of connectedness with his/her school, including, but
not limited to, strategies that promote positive discipline and conflict resolution, the development of resiliency and
interpersonal skills, and the involvement of foster parents, group home administrators, and/or other caretakers in
school programs and activities.
To address the needs of foster youth and help ensure the maximum utilization of available funds, the Superintendent
or designee shall collaborate with local agencies and officials including, but not limited to, the county placing agency,
social services, probation officers, and juvenile court officers. The Superintendent or designee shall explore the
feasibility of entering into agreements with these groups to coordinate services and protect the rights of foster
youth.
At least annually and in accordance with the established timelines, the Superintendent or designee shall report to the
Board on the outcomes for foster youth regarding the goals and specific actions identified in the LCAP, including, but
not limited to, school attendance, student achievement test results, promotion and retention rates by grade level,
graduation rates, and suspension/expulsion rates. As necessary, evaluation data shall be used to determine and
recommend revisions to the LCAP for improving or increasing services for foster youth.
