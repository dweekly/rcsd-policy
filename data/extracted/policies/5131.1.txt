================================================================================

Bus transportation is a privilege extended only to students who display good conduct while preparing to ride, riding
or leaving the bus. Continued disorderly conduct or persistent refusal to submit to the authority of the driver shall be
sufficient reason for a student to be denied transportation.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish regulations related to bus conduct, bus driver authority, and the
suspension of riding privileges. The Board of Education shall make these rules available to parents/guardians and
students. (5 CCR 14103)
Video cameras may be used on school buses to monitor student behavior while traveling to and from school and
school activities. The Board believes that such monitoring will deter misconduct and help to ensure the safety of
students and staff. Students found to be in violation of the district's bus conduct rules shall be subject to discipline in
accordance with district policy and regulations.
At the discretion of the Superintendent or designee, school bus video recordings also may be used to resolve
complaints by students and/or parents/guardians and to help employees maintain discipline.
