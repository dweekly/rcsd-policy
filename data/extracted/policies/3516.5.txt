In order to provide for the safety of students and staff, the Governing Board authorizes the Superintendent or designee to
close a school site, to change the regular school day schedule, or to take any necessary action when hazardous environmental
or weather conditions or other emergencies warrant.
When an emergency condition causes a school closure, reduction in attendance, or change in schedule pursuant to Education
Code 41422 or 46392, thereby preventing the district from complying with the minimum number of instructional days or
minutes required by law, the Superintendent or designee shall complete and submit to the Superintendent of Public
Instruction (SPI) the necessary forms and/or affidavits for obtaining approval of apportionment credit for the days of the
closure, reduction in attendance, or change in schedule. The Superintendent or designee shall submit other relevant district
records as may be required.
For school closures due to emergency events occurring after September 1, 2021, the Superintendent or designee shall
develop a plan for offering independent study within 10 days of school closure to any student impacted by the emergency
condition. The plan shall also address the establishment, within a reasonable time, of independent study master agreements
as specified in BP 6158 - Independent Study. The plan shall require reopening in person as soon as possible once allowable
under the direction from the city or county health officer. The Superintendent or designee shall certify that the district has a
plan for independent study in the affidavit submitted to the SPI pursuant to Education Code 46392. (Education Code 46393)
The Superintendent or designee shall establish a system for informing students and parents/guardians when school buses are
not operating as scheduled, or when the school day schedule is changed or the school is closed. The district's notification
system shall include, but is not limited to, notifying local television and radio stations, posting on district web site(s), sending
email and text messages, and/or making telephone calls.
In the event that students arrive at school when the school day schedule changes or the schedule changes after school has
begun, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that supervision is provided in accordance with the procedures specified
in the district's emergency and disaster preparedness plan.
The Superintendent or designee may provide a means to compensate for lost instructional time later during the year.
Students and parents/guardians shall receive timely advanced notice of any resulting changes in the school calendar or school
day schedule.
