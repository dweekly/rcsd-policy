================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes the importance of keeping accurate, comprehensive student records as required
by law. Procedures for maintaining the confidentiality of student records shall be consistent with state and federal
law.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish regulations governing the identification, collection, retention, and
security of student records, as well as timely access for authorized persons. These regulations shall ensure the rights
of authorized persons to have timely access to student records while maintaining the confidentiality of student
records consistent with state and federal law.
The Superintendent or designee shall designate a certificated employee to serve as custodian of records, with
responsibility for student records at the district level. At each school, the principal or a certificated designee shall act
as custodian of records for students enrolled at that school. The custodian of records shall be responsible for
implementing Board policy and administrative regulation regarding student records. (5 CCR 431)
All appropriate personnel shall receive training regarding district policies and procedures for gathering and handling
sensitive student information.
The district shall not collect or solicit social security numbers or the last four digits of social security numbers of
students or their parents/guardians, unless otherwise required to do so by state or federal law. (Education Code
49076.7)
No information or documents regarding the citizenship or immigration status of students or their family members
shall be collected, except as required by state or federal law or as required to administer a state or federally
supported educational program. The Superintendent or designee shall not disclose student records to a person,
agency, or organization for immigration enforcement purposes without parental consent, a court order, or judicial
subpoena. If a district employee receives such a request, they will immediately report the request to the
Superintendent. The Superintendent shall report the request to the Board in a timely manner that ensures the
confidentiality and privacy of any potentially identifying information. (Education Code 234.7)
The Superintendent or designee shall not compile a list, registry, or database based on students' national origin,
ethnicity, or religious belief, practice, or affiliation, nor shall they disclose student information to federal government
authorities for the purpose of compiling such a list, registry, or database for purposes of immigration enforcement.
Such information may only be compiled or exchanged with other local, state, or federal agencies if the information is
aggregated and is not personally identifiable. (Government Code 8310.3)
Student Records from Social Media
The Superintendent or designee may gather and maintain information from the social media of any district student,
provided that the district first notifies students and parents/guardians about the proposed program, offers an
opportunity for public comment at a regularly scheduled Board meeting, and gathers only information that directly
pertains to school safety or student safety. (Education Code 49073.6)
Contract for Digital Storage, Management, and Retrieval of Student Records
The Superintendent or designee may enter into a contract with a third party for the digital storage, management, and
retrieval of student records and/or to authorize a third party provider of digital software to access, store, and use
student records, provided that the contract meets the requirements of Education Code 49073.1 and other applicable
state and federal laws.
