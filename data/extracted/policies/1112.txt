================================================================================

The Board of Education respects the public's right to information and recognizes that the media significantly
influence the community's understanding of school programs. In order to develop and maintain positive media
relations, the Board and the Superintendent desire to reasonably accommodate media requests for information and
to provide accurate, reliable and timely information.
Media representatives are welcome at all Board meetings and shall receive meeting agendas upon request in
accordance with Board policy.
Media representatives, like all other visitors, shall register immediately upon entering any school building or grounds
when school is in session.
Staff may provide the media with student information, including, but not limited to, the name of a student, school of
attendance, grade level, honors, and activities, unless the student's parent/guardian has submitted a written request
that such information not be disclosed. The district shall not release information that is private or confidential as
required by law, Board policy or administrative regulation. No other access to student records or personally
identifiable student information may be provided without written parent/guardian permission.
Interviewing and Photographing Students
The district shall not impose restraints on students' right to speak freely with media representatives at those times
which do not disrupt a student's educational program. However, interviews of students may not create substantial
disorder or impinge on the rights of others. Therefore, in order to minimize possible disruption, media
representatives who wish to interview students at school are strongly encouraged to make prior arrangements with
the principal. At their discretion, parents/guardians may instruct their children not to communicate with media
representatives.
In order to protect the privacy and safety of students, a media representative who wishes to photograph students on
school grounds should first make arrangements with the principal or designee. Students whose parent/guardian have
submitted a written request that their student be excluded from media coverage shall not be photographed.
When interviewing or photographing a special education student, he/she shall not be identified as a special
education student without prior, written parent/guardian permission.
Media Communications Plan
In order to help develop strong relations with the media, the Superintendent or designee shall develop a proactive
media communications plan. This plan may include, but not be limited to, information related to district programs and
needs, student awards, school accomplishments and events of special interest.
The plan shall specify the district's and/or site's primary media contact to whom all media inquiries shall be routed.
Spokespersons designated to speak to the media on behalf of the district include the Board president,
Superintendent or designee. Other Board members and staff may be asked by the Superintendent or designee to
speak to the media on a case-by-case basis, depending on their expertise on an issue. Only a designated district
spokesperson should express viewpoints on behalf of the district. If a district employee speaks to the media as a
private citizen, he/she must make clear that he/she is not speaking as a representative of the district.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide training on effective media relations to all designated spokespersons.
Crisis Communications Plan
During a disturbance or crisis situation, the first priority of school staff is to assure the safety of students and staff.
However, the Board recognizes the need to provide timely and accurate information to parents/guardians and the
community during a crisis. The Board also recognizes that the media have an important role to play in relaying this
information to the public. In order to help ensure that the media and district work together effectively, the
Superintendent or designee shall develop a crisis communications plan to identify communication strategies to be
taken in the event of a crisis.
The crisis communications plan may include but not be limited to identification of a media center location,
development of both internal and external notification systems, and strategies for press conference logistics.
