================================================================================

The Board of Education realizes that the schools alone cannot meet children's complex individual needs.
Parents/guardians, schools, local government, businesses, foundations and community-based organizations all must
work together to assess needs, improve conditions for our community's youth, and ensure that the multiple services
needed by children and families are coordinated so as to avoid gaps, duplication or delay.
The Board shall initiate or participate in collaborative relationships with city and county leaders to develop local
policies and provide effective multi-agency programs that respond to the needs of children and families.
The Superintendent and staff shall contact and cooperate with public and private agencies to ensure the availability
and effective implementation of child care, after-school, nutrition, health and other services for children.
The Board shall regularly evaluate the progress of collaborative efforts and shall monitor district budget, facilities and
personnel priorities for opportunities to promote community collaboration and youth services.
The Board shall advocate for local, state and national policies, legislation and programs designed to provide or better
coordinate services for children and families.
The district shall provide support services for children and families to the extent possible.
