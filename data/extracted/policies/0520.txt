The Governing Board desires that all district schools provide a high-quality educational program that
maximizes the achievement of each district student. The district shall provide assistance to schools to
support the continuous improvement of student performance within the priorities identified in the district's
local control and accountability plan (LCAP) and to enhance the achievement of low-performing student
subgroups.
At its discretion, the Board may submit a request to the County Superintendent of Schools for technical
assistance regarding the following: (Education Code 52071)
1. Iden5fying the district's strengths and weaknesses in regard to state priori5es addressed in the LCAP,
including collabora5on between the district and County Superintendent to review performance data
on the state and local indicators included in the California School Dashboard and other relevant local
data and to iden5fy eﬀec5ve, evidence-based programs or prac5ces that address any areas of
weakness
2. Securing assistance from an academic, programma5c, or ﬁscal expert, or team of experts, to iden5fy
and implement eﬀec5ve programs and prac5ces that are designed to improve performance in any
areas of weakness identified by the district
In the event that the County Superintendent requires the district to receive technical assistance based on a
determination that one or more numerically significant student subgroups in a district school meet the
performance criteria established pursuant Education Code 52064.5, the Board shall work with the County
Superintendent and shall provide the County Superintendent timely documentation of the district's
completion of the activities listed in items #1-2 above or substantially similar activities. (Education Code
52071)
With the approval of the County Superintendent, the district may, at its own expense, engage another
service provider, including, but not limited to, another school district, the county office of education, or a
charter school, to act as a partner to the district in filling the district’s need for technical assistance.
(Education Code 52071)
If referred to the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence by either the County Superintendent or
the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI), the district shall implement the recommendations of that
agency in order to accomplish the goals set forth in the district's LCAP. (Education Code 52071, 52074)
If the SPI identifies the district as needing intervention, the district shall cooperate with any action taken by
the SPI or any academic advisor appointed by the SPI, which may include one or more of the following:
(Education Code 52072)
1. Revision of the district's LCAP
2. Revision of the district's budget, in conjunc5on with changes in the LCAP, that would allow the district
to improve the outcomes for all student subgroups in regard to state and local priorities
3. A determina5on to stay or rescind any district ac5on that would prevent the district from improving
outcomes for all student subgroups, provided that ac5on is not required by a collec5ve bargaining
agreement
In addition, any school identified by the California Department of Education for comprehensive support and
improvement, targeted support and improvement, or additional targeted support and improvement shall
develop and implement a school plan in accordance with 20 USC 6311. Such schools may be required to
partner with an external entity, agency, or individual with demonstrated expertise and capacity to identify
and implement more rigorous interventions.
