================================================================================

The Board of Education is committed to providing a school environment that promotes the safety of students,
employees, and visitors to school grounds. The Board also recognizes the importance of protecting district property,
facilities, and equipment from vandalism and theft.
In consultation with relevant staff, the Superintendent or designee shall develop campus security procedures which
are consistent with the goals and objectives of the district's comprehensive safety plan and site-level safety plans.
Such procedures shall be regularly reviewed to reflect changed circumstances and to assess their effectiveness in
achieving safe school objectives.
Surveillance Systems
The Board believes that reasonable use of surveillance cameras will help the district achieve its goals for campus
security. In consultation with relevant staff, the Superintendent or designee shall identify appropriate locations for
the placement of surveillance cameras. Cameras shall not be placed in areas where students, staff, or community
members have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Any audio capability on the district's surveillance equipment shall
be disabled so that sounds are not recorded.
Prior to the operation of the surveillance system, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that signs are posted
at conspicuous locations at affected school buildings and grounds. These signs shall inform students, staff, and
visitors that surveillance may occur and shall state whether the district's system is actively monitored by school
personnel. The Superintendent or designee shall also provide prior written notice to students and parents/guardians
about the district's surveillance system, including the locations where surveillance may occur, explaining that the
recordings may be used in disciplinary proceedings, and that matters captured by the camera may be referred to local
law enforcement, as appropriate.
To the extent that any images from the district's surveillance system create a student or personnel record, the
Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the images are accessed, retained, and disclosed in accordance with
law, Board policy, administrative regulation, and any applicable collective bargaining agreements.
