District records shall be developed, maintained, and disposed of in accordance with law and California Department of
Education regulations.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish regulations that define records which are permanent, optional, and
disposable and specify how each type of record is to be maintained or destroyed. Any photographic, microfilm, or
electronic copies of original records shall be permanently retained.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure the confidentiality of records as required by law and shall establish
regulations to safeguard data against damage or loss.
Safe at Home Program
District public records shall not include the actual addresses of students, parents/guardians, or employees when a
substitute address is designated by the Secretary of State pursuant to the Safe at Home program. (Government Code
6206, 6207)
When a substitute address card is provided pursuant to this program, the confidential, actual address may be used
only to establish district residency requirements for enrollment and for school emergency purposes.
