The Board of Education recognizes that it has a direct responsibility to select and employ the Superintendent.
Whenever it becomes necessary for the Board to fill a vacancy in the position of Superintendent, the Board shall
work diligently to employ a person whose management and leadership abilities are most closely aligned with district
needs.
The Board shall establish and implement a search and selection process that includes consideration of:
1. The district's current and long-term needs, including a review of the district's vision and goals
 
2. The desired characteristics of a new Superintendent, including professional experience, educational
qualifications, leadership characteristics, philosophy of education, and other management, technical,
interpersonal and conceptual skills, as well as the priorities the Board wants to place on different abilities, traits
and levels of knowledge
 
3. The scope of the search, including whether to promote from within the district or broaden the search to
include both internal and external candidates and, if external candidates will be considered, whether to
conduct a statewide or nationwide search
 
4. The salary range and benefits to be offered
 
5. Basic elements to be included in the Superintendent's contract
 
6. Whether to hire a professional adviser to facilitate the process
 
7. How and when to involve the community in certain phases of the selection process
 
8. The best methods for advertising the vacancy and recruiting qualified candidates
 
9. The process for screening applications and determining how the screener(s) will be selected
 
10. Interview questions, processes and participants
 
11. How and when candidates' qualifications will be verified through reference checks
 
12. Other actions necessary to ensure a fair selection process and a smooth transition to new leadership
Even if a professional adviser is used to facilitate the process, the Board shall retain the right and responsibility to
oversee the process and to review all applications if desired.
The Board shall select candidates to be interviewed based on recommendations of the screener(s) and the Board's
own assessment of how candidates meet the criteria established by the Board.
The Board shall interview preliminary and final candidates in closed session and determine the most likely match for
the district. (Government Code 54957)
The selected candidate shall hold both a valid school administration certificate and a valid teacher's certificate. The
Board may waive any credential requirement, but shall not employ a person whose credential has been revoked by
the Commission on Teacher Credentialing pursuant to Education Code 44421-44427. (Education Code 35028,
35029, 35029.1)
Before offering the position to the selected candidate or making any announcements, Board members may visit that
candidate's current district, as appropriate, to obtain verification of his/her qualifications.
The Board shall deliberate in closed session to affirm the selection of the candidate and shall report the selection in
open session. (Government Code 54957)
The Board shall conduct these proceedings in accordance with legal and ethical obligations regarding confidentiality
and equal opportunity.
