The Governing Board recognizes that student organizations can provide students with an opportunity to conduct worthwhile
co-curricular activities while helping students learn about effective financial practices and develop leadership and
management skills. To that end, the Board may approve the formation of associated student body organizations which are
composed entirely of students, operate under the oversight of the principal or other district- employed advisor, and are
subject to the control and regulation of the Board. Student organizations may raise and spend funds to support activities that
promote the general welfare, morale, and educational experiences of the student body.
Fundraising
At the beginning of each school year, each principal or designee shall submit to the Superintendent or designee a list of the
fund-raising events that each student organization proposes to hold that year. The Superintendent or designee shall review
the proposed events and determine whether the events contribute to the educational experience and are not in conflict with
or detract from the school's educational program. When reviewing proposed events, the Superintendent or designee shall
consider the effects of the activities on student health and safety, evaluate the risk of liability to the district, and ensure that
the proposed activities are in compliance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.
Management and Reporting of Funds
Student body funds shall be managed in accordance with law, regulations, Board policies, and sound business procedures
designed to encourage the largest possible educational return to students without sacrificing the security of funds.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop internal control procedures to safeguard the organization's assets, promote the
success of fund-raising ventures, provide reliable financial information, and reduce the risk of fraud and abuse. These
procedures shall detail the oversight of activities and funds including, but not limited to, the appropriate role and provision of
training for staff and students, parameters for events on campus, appropriate and prohibited uses of funds, and accounting
and record-keeping processes, including procedures for handling questionable expenditures.
The principal or designee shall be responsible for the proper conduct of all student organization financial activities. The
budget adopted by the student body organization should serve as the financial plan for the school year and shall be submitted
to the Superintendent or designee at the beginning of each school year. The Superintendent or designee shall periodically
review the organization's use of funds to ensure compliance with the district's internal control procedures.
Funds derived from the student body shall be disbursed according to procedures established by the student organization. All
disbursements must be approved by a Board-designated employee or official, the certificated employee who is the
designated student organization advisor, and a student organization representative. (Education Code 48933)
When student body funds are expended for equipment, supplies, or activities that support the district's athletic
program, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the expenditures are aligned with the district's
commitment to provide equitable opportunities for males and females.
Because of the district's administrative and/or direct financial involvement in the assets of the student organization, the
student activity fund shall be reported in a fiduciary fund in accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board
Statement 84.
The Board shall provide an annual audit of student accounts by a certified public accountant. The cost of the audit shall be
paid from district funds. (Education Code 41020)
