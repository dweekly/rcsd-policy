================================================================================

The Governing Board recognizes that district employees may receive compensation for outside activities as long as these activities are not
inconsistent, incompatible, in conflict with or inimical to the employee's duties or to the duties, functions or responsibilities of the district.
Outside paid activities shall be considered inconsistent, incompatible, or inimical to district employment when such activity: 
 1. Requires time periods that interfere with the proper, efficient discharge of the employee's duties
 2. Entails compensation from an outside source for activities which are part of the employee's regular duties
 3. Involves using the district's name, prestige, time, facilities, equipment or supplies for private gain
 4. Involves service which will be wholly or in part subject to the approval or control of another district employee or Board member
An employee wishing to accept outside employment that may be inconsistent, incompatible, in conflict with, or inimical to the employee's duties
shall file a written request with his/her immediate supervisor describing the nature of the employment and the time required. The supervisor
shall evaluate each request based on the employee's specific duties within the district and determine whether or not to grant authorization for
such employment.
The supervisor shall inform the employee in writing whether or not the outside employment is prohibited. The employee may appeal a
supervisor's denial of authorization to the Superintendent or designee. An employee who continues to pursue a prohibited activity may be
subject to disciplinary action. 
Tutoring
The District may offer school sponsored intervention and enrichment programs at school sites paid out of District funds. If a certificated
employee wishes to tutor a student privately on campus, outside of a school sponsored program, the employee must complete a facilities use
agreement, pay any associated fees, and provide any materials or equipment.
