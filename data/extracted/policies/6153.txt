The Governing Board recognizes that school-sponsored trips are an important component of a student's development. 
Field Trips supplement and enrich the classroom learning experience. School-sponsored trips shall be conducted in 
connection with the district's course of study or school-related social, educational, cultural, athletic, school band 
activities, or other extracurricular or cocurricular activities. A field trip to a foreign country may be permitted to 
familiarize students with the language, history, geography, natural science, and other studies relative to the district's 
course of study. (Education Code 35330) Because the Board believes that student safety is of paramount importance, no 
chaperone shall consume alcohol or illegal drugs while on a school-sponsored trip. 
Requests for school-sponsored trips involving out-of-state, out-of-country, or overnight travel shall be submitted to the 
Superintendent or designee. The Superintendent or designee shall review the request and make a recommendation to the 
Board as to whether the request should be approved by the Board. All other school-sponsored trips shall be approved in 
advance by the principal.
The principal shall establish a process for approving a staff member's request to conduct a school-sponsored trip. When 
planning trips, staff shall consider student safety, objectives of instruction, the most effective use of instructional time, 
the distance from school, district and student expense, and transportation and supervision requirements. Principals may 
exclude from the trip any student whose presence on the trip would pose a safety or disciplinary risk.
No field trip shall be authorized if any student would be excluded from participation because of a lack of sufficient 
funds. The Superintendent or designee shall coordinate with community groups to supply funds for students in need. 
(Education Code 35330).
The Governing Board may approve the use of district funds for student expenses for in-state, out-of-state, or out-of-
country field trips or excursions when permitted by law. In addition, expenses of instructors, chaperones, and other 
personnel participating in such trips, as well as incidental expenses for the use of district equipment during the trip, may 
be paid from district funds. (Education Code 35330).
