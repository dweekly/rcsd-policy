================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes the importance of minimizing the district's use of natural resources, providing a
high-quality environment that promotes health and productivity, and effectively managing the district's fiscal
resources. To that end, the Superintendent or designee may develop a resource management program which
includes strategies for implementing effective and sustainable resource practices, exploring renewable and clean
energy technologies, reducing energy and water consumption, minimizing utility costs, reducing the amount of waste
of consumable materials, encouraging recycling and green procurement practices, and promoting conservation
principles.
The Superintendent or designee shall regularly inspect district facilities and operations and make recommendations
for maintenance and capital expenditures which may help the district reach its conservation and management goals.
The Superintendent or designee shall make every effort to identify funding opportunities and cost-reducing incentive
programs to help the district achieve its conservation and management goals.
The Superintendent or designee shall periodically report to the Board on the district's progress in meeting its
conservation and management goals.
Storm Water Management
The Board desires to ensure that, to the maximum extent practicable, the district reduce the discharge of pollutants
into the water system in order to minimize the threat to water quality from storm water runoff. When the district has
been designated by the State Water Resources Control Board or a regional water quality control board, the
Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district complies with applicable General Permit requirements.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop a storm water management plan and shall submit the plan and a
resolution authorizing the implementation of the plan to the Board for approval. The district's plan shall describe best
management practices, measurable goals, and timetables for implementation in the following areas:
1. Public education and outreach on storm water impacts
 
2. Public participation, such as participation in adoption and implementation of the plan
 
3. Illicit discharge detection and elimination, such as maps and programs to detect and eliminate illicit non-storm
water discharges
 
4. Construction site storm water runoff control, such as reviewing construction plans, inspecting sites, and
tracking construction site runoff, as well as erosion and sediment controls
 
5. Post-construction storm water management, such as developing design standards for preventing runoff and
verifying proper maintenance and operation of control procedures
 
6. Pollution prevention and good housekeeping, such as evaluating waste disposal, material storage, and
equipment-cleaning procedures and spill prevention, including at bus maintenance facilities
The Superintendent or designee shall regularly report to the Board on the status of the district's implementation
efforts.
