The Superintendent or designee shall establish a plan describing actions to be taken, including staff responsibilities,
when an individual is causing a disruption. In developing such a plan, the Superintendent or designee shall consult
with law enforcement to create guidelines for law enforcement support and intervention in the event of a disruption.
School staff shall be trained to recognize when an individual has committed acts that constitute a disruption in
violation of Board policy or administrative regulation. Staff who believe that a disruption may occur shall immediately
contact the principal.
