================================================================================

To foster intercultural understanding, communication and respect in an increasingly diverse society, curriculum and
instruction at all grade levels shall reflect the perspective and experiences of various cultural, ethnic, racial and social
groups. The Board of Education desires that multicultural education be integrated across the curriculum into as many
subjects as possible rather than providing isolated lessons on different cultures.
The district's comprehensive multicultural education program shall recognize the contributions of different groups of
people to the history, life and culture of the local community, California, the United States and other nations. It may
include but not be limited to instruction about the languages, cultural characteristics, significant events and
individuals, and social, political and economic conditions of various ethnic groups.
While recognizing the unique aspects of different cultures and peoples, multicultural education shall also emphasize
commonalities and challenge the stereotypes and biases that inhibit intergroup understanding. Multicultural
education also shall be designed to contribute to the personal development of students through greater self-
understanding, positive self-concept and pride in one's ethnic identity.
These references are not intended to be part of the policy itself, nor do they indicate the basis or authority
for the Governing Board to enact this policy. Instead, they are provided as additional resources for those interested in the subject matter
of the policy.
