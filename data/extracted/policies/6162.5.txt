The Board of Education believes that the primary goal of student assessments should be to help students,
parents/guardians and teachers identify individual student's academic accomplishments, progress and areas needing
improvement in order to enhance teaching and learning.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that assessments are conducted for purposes of determining students'
eligibility for and appropriate placement in district programs, need for supplemental instruction and eligibility for
promotion.
The Board desires to use a variety of evaluation measures to reach the above-stated goal. To have validity, tests
must correspond to the material that is being taught and reliably measure the extent to which students meet
specified standards of achievement.
The effectiveness of the instructional programs shall be evaluated on the basis of these student assessments.
When districtwide and school-level results of student assessments are published, the Superintendent or designee
may provide supplementary information to assist parents/guardians and the local community in interpreting test
results and evaluating school performance.
