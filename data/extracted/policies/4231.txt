The Superintendent or designee shall involve classified staff, site and district administrators, and others, as
appropriate, in the development of the district's staff development program. They shall ensure that the district's staff
development program is aligned with district goals, school improvement objectives, the local control and
accountability plan, and other district and school plans.

other training designed to improve student performance, conflict resolution, and relationships among students. Such
professional learning opportunities shall be evaluated based on criteria specified in Education Code 44277 and BP

The district's staff evaluation process may be used to recommend additional individualized staff development for
individual employees.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide a means for continual evaluation of the benefit of staff development
activities to staff and the district and shall regularly report to the Board regarding the effectiveness of the staff
