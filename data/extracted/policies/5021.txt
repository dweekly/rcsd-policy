================================================================================

Noncustodial parents generally retain the same rights as custodial parents unless a court order restricts the rights of
the noncustodial parent. These rights include but are not limited to accessing his/her child's student records,
participating in school activities and visiting the child at school. If a completed or pending legal action curtails the
noncustodial parent's rights, the parent/guardian with custody shall provide evidence of this action to the
Superintendent or designee.
Upon request, the district shall provide noncustodial parents with announcements and notices that are sent to the
custodial parent.
While both parents can visit the child at school, only the custodial parent has the right to remove the child from
school property. Only a verified note or an emergency card from the custodial parent will be cause for exception to
this provision.
In the event of an attempted violation of a court order that restricts access to a student, staff shall contact the
custodial parent and local law enforcement officials and shall make the student available only after one or both of
these parties consent.
