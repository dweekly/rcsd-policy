The Board of Education believes that regular and comprehensive evaluations can help instructional staff improve
their teaching skills and raise students' levels of achievement. Evaluations also serve to hold staff accountable for
their performance. The Superintendent or designee shall evaluate the performance of certificated staff members in
accordance with law, negotiated employee contracts and Board-adopted evaluation standards.
Objective standards from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and/or the California Standards for
the Teaching Profession shall be reviewed and may be incorporated in district evaluation standards with the
agreement of the exclusive representative of the certificated staff.
Evaluation procedures may include observation of teacher performance in the classroom.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that evaluation ratings have uniform meaning throughout the district.
Evaluations shall be used to recognize the exemplary skills and accomplishments of staff and to identify areas
needing improvement. When areas needing improvement are identified, the Board expects employees to accept
responsibility for improving their performance. The Superintendent or designee shall assist employees in improving
their performance and may require participation in appropriate programs. Staff members are encouraged to take
initiative to request assistance as necessary to promote effective teaching.
