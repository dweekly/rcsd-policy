The Board of Education desires to provide a safe school environment that allows all students equal access and
opportunities in the district's academic, extracurricular, and other educational support programs, services, and
activities. The Board prohibits, at any district school or school activity, unlawful discrimination, including
discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying based on actual or perceived age, ancestry, ethnicity, parental
status, pregnancy status, color, mental or physical disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, genetic
information, immigration status, marital status, medical information, nationality, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation,
or association with a person or a group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics. This applies to
all acts related to school activity or school attendance within any school under the jurisdiction of the superintendent
of Redwood City School District.
(California Education Code [EC] sections 200, 220, 221.5, 234.1[a], 234.7, and 260; California Government Code
[GC] Section 11135; California Penal Code [PC] Section 422.55; California Code of Regulations, Title 5 [5 CCR]
sections 4900, 4902, and 4960)
This policy shall apply to all acts related to school activity or to school attendance occurring within a district school,
and to acts which occur off campus or outside of school-related or school-sponsored activities but which may have
an impact or create a hostile environment at school.
Unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, or bullying, may result from physical,
verbal, nonverbal, or written conduct based on any of the categories listed above. Unlawful discrimination also
includes the creation of a hostile environment through prohibited conduct that is so severe, persistent, or pervasive
that it affects a student's ability to participate in or benefit from an educational program or activity; creates an
intimidating, threatening, hostile, or offensive educational environment; has the effect of substantially or
unreasonably interfering with a student's academic performance; or otherwise adversely affects a student's
educational opportunities.
Unlawful discrimination also includes disparate treatment of students based on one of the categories above with
respect to the provision of opportunities to participate in school programs or activities or the provision or receipt of
educational benefits or services.
The Board also prohibits any form of retaliation against any individual who reports or participates in the reporting of
unlawful discrimination, files or participates in the filing of a complaint, or investigates or participates in the
investigation of a complaint or report alleging unlawful discrimination. Retaliation complaints shall be investigated
and resolved in the same manner as a discrimination complaint.
The Superintendent or designee shall facilitate students' access to the educational program by publicizing the
district's nondiscrimination policy and related complaint procedures to students, parents/guardians, and employees.
They will provide training and information on the scope and use of the policy and complaint procedures and take
other measures designed to increase the school community's understanding of the requirements of law related to
discrimination. The Superintendent or designee shall regularly review the implementation of the district's
nondiscrimination policies and practices and, as necessary, shall take action to remove any identified barrier to
student access to or participation in the district's educational program. They will report their findings and
recommendations to the Board after each review.
Regardless of whether a complainant complies with the writing, timeline, and/or other formal filing requirements, all
complaints alleging unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, or bullying, shall be
investigated and prompt action taken to stop the discrimination, prevent recurrence, and address any continuing
effect on students.
Students who engage in unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, retaliation, or
bullying, in violation of law, Board policy, or administrative regulation shall be subject to appropriate consequence or
discipline, which may include suspension or expulsion when the behavior is severe or pervasive as defined in
Education Code 48900.4. Any employee who permits or engages in prohibited discrimination, including
discriminatory harassment, intimidation, retaliation, or bullying, shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and
including dismissal.



Record-Keeping
The Superintendent or designee shall maintain a record of all reported cases of unlawful discrimination, including
discriminatory harassment, intimidation, or bullying, to enable the district to monitor, address, and prevent repetitive
prohibited behavior in district schools.
