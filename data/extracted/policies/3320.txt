promotes the health and safety of students, staff, and the public. Any and all claims for money or damages against the district
shall be presented to and acted upon in accordance with the Government Claims Act or other applicable state or district

Upon notice to the district of a claim, the Superintendent or designee shall take all necessary steps to protect the district's
rights under any applicable contractual agreements, including the right to indemnification from its insurance or other
coverage provider.

pursuant to any conditions of coverage in the district's JPA agreement or insurance coverage.
