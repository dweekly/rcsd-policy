The Governing Board recognizes the importance of maintaining ongoing positive relations with employees
and engaging in fair, respectful negotiations with employee organizations. The Board desires to reach
agreement on employment contracts in a manner that prevents disruption to school operations and
minimizes impact on student achievement.
The Board recognizes that advance planning is necessary to ensure that, in the event of a work stoppage,
strike, or other concerted employee activity, students continue to receive educational services to which they
are entitled. The Superintendent or designee shall develop a written plan which shall include strategies for
the provision of internal and external communications, preservation of student and staff safety, maintenance
of district operations, and appropriate student instruction and supervision during a work slowdown or
stoppage.
If an employee organization gives notice that it intends to strike, the Superintendent or designee shall notify
the Public Employment Relations Board, Employment Development Department, employees in the striking
unit, other district employees, parents/guardians, students, law enforcement, the media, and others as
appropriate.
Employees should be held accountable for their behavior during any labor dispute. The district may take
disciplinary action against any employee who engages in an unlawful concerted action or in unlawful
behavior in an otherwise protected activity, taking into account the seriousness of the behavior and the
district's efforts to rebuild relations following the withholding of services by employees.
