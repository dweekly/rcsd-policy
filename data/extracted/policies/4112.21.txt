================================================================================

The Board of Education may employ interns to fulfill the district's need for additional instructional resources and to
assist future teachers in meeting state credentialing requirements by linking teaching theory with practice. The
Superintendent or designee shall ensure that such persons possess appropriate internship credentials from the
Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC).
The Superintendent or designee may enter into an agreement with an accredited college or university to provide
supervised teaching experiences within the district as part of a teacher preparation program. He/she shall ensure
that the district collaborates with a college or university in the selection, placement, support, and performance
assessment of interns.
Interns shall not be assigned to teach any classes outside the subject area, grade levels, or classes authorized by their
credentials.
Any intern hired to teach core academic subjects, as defined in law, shall be required to meet the definition of a
"highly qualified" teacher adopted by the State Board of Education. (20 USC 6319, 7801; 5 CCR 6100-6112)
Terms of employment for interns shall be consistent with law and the district's collective bargaining agreement, as
applicable.
Interns shall receive support and assistance to enhance their instructional skills and knowledge, and may be assigned
a mentor teacher, when state funding is available for the mentor teacher program, at the school where the intern is
employed.
Interns shall be provided with ongoing feedback regarding their performance and shall be formally evaluated at least
once every year in accordance with Board policy and the district's collective bargaining agreement.
