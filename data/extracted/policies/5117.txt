================================================================================

The Governing Board recognizes that parents/guardians of students who reside within the geographic boundaries of one
district may, for a variety of reasons, desire to enroll their children in a school in another district.
Following the principle that the financial and educational responsibility for a student's education rests primarily with the
school district of legal residence, it is the policy of the Governing Board that students should attend school in the district of
legal residence.
The Board discourages transfers into the District and will consider approving such transfers only on a case-by-case basis
through an inter-district attendance agreement or as otherwise required by law. The Board may enter into an agreement with
any other school district, for a term not to exceed five school years, for the inter-district attendance of students who are
residents of the districts. The agreement shall specify the terms and conditions under which inter-district attendance shall be
permitted or denied. It also may contain standards agreed upon by both districts for reapplication and/or revocation of the
student's permit. (Education Code 46600) Upon receiving a permit for transfer into the district that has been approved by the
student's district of residence, or upon receiving a written request from the parent/guardian of a district student who wishes
to enroll in another district, the Superintendent or designee shall review the request and may approve or deny the permit
subject to the terms and conditions of the inter-district attendance agreement.
Students residing outside the District who are discovered to be attending district schools without an authorized inter-district
attendance agreement will be disenrolled barring extenuating circumstances. Inter-district agreements for special education
students are subject to procedures outlined in the San Mateo County Special Education Local Plan (SELPA), Regulation
Section IV, F-1 and F-2 (Exhibit Y).
Transportation: Upon parent/guardian request, the district may provide transportation assistance to a student receiving an
inter- district transfer who is eligible for free and reduced-price meals and if the child of an active duty military
parent/guardian or a victim of bullying, as defined in Education Code 46600. (Education Code 46600) In addition, upon
request of a student's parent/guardian, the Superintendent or designee may authorize transportation for any inter-district
transfer student to and from designated bus stops within the attendance area of the school that the student attends if space
is available.
If an interdistrict transfer student is approved and enrolls in a District school, that student must remain at that school. Intra-
district transfers do not apply.
Interdistrict Attendance Agreements and Permits
The District is currently not accepting new interdistrict transfers unless granted by the Superintendent and the Governing
Board.
