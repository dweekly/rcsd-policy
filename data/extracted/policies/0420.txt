The Board of Education believes that comprehensive planning that is aligned with the district's local control and
accountability plan (LCAP) is necessary at each school, in order to focus school improvement efforts on student
academic achievement and facilitate the effective use of available resources. The Superintendent or designee shall
ensure that school plans provide clear direction and identify cohesive strategies aligned with school and district
goals.
Each district school shall establish a school site council in accordance with Education Code 52852 and the
accompanying administrative regulation to develop, review, and approve school plans.
For any school that participates in specified state and/or federal categorical programs, the school site council or
other schoolwide advisory committee shall consolidate the plans required for those categorical programs into a
single plan for student achievement (SPSA). (Education Code 64001)
As appropriate, a school may incorporate any other school program into the SPSA. (Education Code 64001)
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that a single plan for student achievement is prepared by the school site
council as required by law for each school participating in specified state and/or federal categorical programs.
(Education Code 41507, 41572, 52055.755, 64001)
As appropriate, any other school plan may be incorporated into the single plan for student achievement.
The Superintendent or designee shall review each school's SPSA and ensure that it has been developed and
approved by a properly constituted school site council, meets the content requirements for all programs included, is
based on an analysis of current practices and student academic performance, and reasonably links improvement
strategies to identified needs of the school and students.
They shall also ensure that specific actions included in the district's LCAP are consistent with the strategies identified
in each school's SPSA.
The Board shall review and approve each school's single plan for student achievement at a regularly scheduled
meeting. The Board also shall review and approve any subsequent revisions that include material changes affecting
the academic programs for students participating in these categorical programs. The Board shall certify that, to the
extent allowable under federal law, the plan is consistent with district local improvement plans required as a
condition of receiving federal funding. (Education Code 64001)
Whenever the Board does not approve a school's SPSA, it shall communicate its specific reasons for disapproval of
the plan to the school site council or committee. The school site council or committee shall then revise and resubmit
the SPSA to the Board for its approval. (Education Code 52855)
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that principals and members of each site council receive training on the
roles and responsibilities of the site council. To the extent necessary, they shall ensure that site councils receive the
resources necessary in order to perform their role effectively.
