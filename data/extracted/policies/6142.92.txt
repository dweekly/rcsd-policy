================================================================================

The Board of Education desires to offer a rigorous mathematics program that provides a strong foundation in basic
mathematical skills and prepares students to apply mathematics in real life. The Superintendent or designee shall
develop grade-level curricula that offer a balanced instructional program, including but not limited to:
1. Basic mathematical skills: quantification, basic facts, sorting and classification, and computational skills
including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, decimals, squares and square roots
 
2. Conceptual understanding: knowledge and application of facts and definitions, identification of principles,
understanding of relationships among mathematical concepts, recognition and application of signs, symbols
and terms
 
3. Problem solving: use of mathematical concepts, skills, tools and reasoning strategies to formulate and solve
problems in a variety of situations
The mathematics program shall develop such knowledge and skills in the subject areas of numbers, measurement,
geometry, functions, statistics and probability, logic, algebra and discrete mathematics. Students should know,
understand and demonstrate concepts through their application to classroom and real-life situations.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all students have many opportunities to take the full range of
mathematics course options.
The Board shall establish specific content and performance standards in mathematical skills, concepts and problem-
solving ability for each grade level. Students at risk of failing to meet performance standards shall receive additional
assistance and intervention.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that certificated staff have opportunities to participate in professional
development activities designed to increase their knowledge and skills in effective mathematics teaching practices.
Students shall have access to sufficient instructional materials, including manipulatives and technology, to support a
balanced mathematics program.
