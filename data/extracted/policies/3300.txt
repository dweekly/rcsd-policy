================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes its fiduciary responsibility to oversee the prudent expenditure of district funds. In
order to best serve district interests, the Superintendent or designee shall develop and maintain effective purchasing
procedures that are consistent with sound financial controls and that ensure the district receives maximum value for
items purchased. He/she shall ensure that records of expenditures and purchases are maintained in accordance with
law.
Expending Authority
The Board shall review all transactions entered into by the Superintendent or designee on behalf of the Board every
60 days. (Education Code 17605)
The Superintendent or designee may authorize an expenditure which exceeds the budget classification allowance
against which the expenditure is the proper charge only if an amount sufficient to cover the purchase is available in
the budget for transfer by the Board.
District funds shall not be expended for the purchase of alcoholic beverages. (Education Code 32435)
Purchasing Procedures
Insofar as possible, goods and services purchased shall meet the needs of the person or department ordering them at
the lowest price consistent with standard purchasing practices. Maintenance costs, replacement costs, and trade-in
values shall be considered when determining the most economical purchase price. When price, fitness, and quality
are equal, recycled products shall be preferred when procuring materials for use in district schools and buildings.
When price, fitness, and quality are equal, the district shall endeavor to purchase from local vendors.
All purchases shall be made by formal contract or purchase order and shall be accompanied by a receipt. In order to
eliminate the processing of numerous small purchase orders, the Superintendent or designee may create a "blanket"
or "open" purchase order system for the purchase of minor items as needed from a vendor. He/she shall ensure that
the "open" purchase order system details a maximum purchase amount, the types of items that can be purchased
under this order, the individuals authorized to approve purchases, and the expiration date of the "open" order.
