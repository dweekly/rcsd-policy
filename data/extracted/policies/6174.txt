The Board of Education intends to provide English learners with challenging curriculum and instruction that maximize
the attainment of high levels of proficiency in English, advance multilingual capabilities, and facilitate student
achievement in the district's regular course of study.
English learners shall be provided differentiated English language development instruction which is targeted to their
English proficiency level. Such instruction shall be based on sound instructional theory, be aligned with state content
standards, emphasize inquiry-based learning and critical thinking skills, and be integrated across all subject areas.
No middle school student who is an English learner shall be denied enrollment in any of the following: (Education
Code 60811.8)
1. Courses in the core curriculum areas of reading/language arts, mathematics, science, and history-social
science, or courses required for middle school grade promotion
However, an English learner may be denied participation in any such course if the student has been enrolled in
a school in the United States for less than 12 months or is enrolled in a program designed to develop the basic
English skills of newly arrived immigrant students, and the course of study provided to the student is designed
to remedy academic deficits incurred during participation and to enable the student to attain parity of
participation in the standard instructional program within a reasonable length of time after the student enters
the school system.
 
2. A full course load of courses specified in item #1 above
 
3. Other courses that are advanced courses such as honors or Advanced Placement courses, on the sole basis of
the student's classification as an English learner
The district shall identify in its local control and accountability plan (LCAP) goals and specific actions and services to
enhance student engagement, academic achievement, and other outcomes for English learners.
The Superintendent or designee shall encourage parent/guardian and community involvement in the development
and evaluation of programs for English learners. The Superintendent or designee may also provide an English
Development literacy training program for parents/guardians and community members so that they may better
support students' English language development.
Staff Qualifications and Training
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all staff employed to teach English learners possess the appropriate
authorization from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing.
The district shall provide effective professional development to teachers (including teachers in classroom settings
that are not the settings of language instruction educational programs), administrators, and other school or
community-based organization personnel to improve the instruction and assessment of English learners and enhance
staff's ability to understand and use curricula, assessment, and instructional strategies for English learners. Such
professional development shall be of sufficient intensity and duration to produce a positive and lasting impact on
teachers' performance in the classroom.
To oversee test administration, the Superintendent or designee shall annually designate a district ELPAC coordinator
and a site coordinator for each test site in accordance with 5 CCR 11518.40-11518.45.
Identification and Assessment
Once identified as an English learner, a student shall be annually assessed for language proficiency until the student
is reclassified based on criteria specified in the accompanying administrative regulation.
In addition, English learners' academic achievement in English language arts, mathematics, science, and any additional
subject required by law shall be assessed using the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress. As
necessary, the test shall be administered with testing variations in accordance with 5 CCR 854.1-854.3. English
Board Policy Manual
Redwood City School District

learners who are in their first 12 months of attending a school in the United States shall be exempted from taking the
English language arts assessment to the extent allowed by federal law. (Education Code 60603, 60640; 5 CCR
854.1-854.3.)
Formative assessments may be utilized to analyze student performance and appropriately adapt teaching
methodologies and instructions.
Language Acquisition Programs
The district shall offer research-based language acquisition programs that are designed to ensure English acquisition
as rapidly and as effectively as possible and that provide instruction to students on the state-adopted academic
content standards, including the English language development standards. (Education Code 306; 5 CCR 11300)
At a minimum, the district shall offer a structured English immersion program which includes designated and
integrated English language development. In the structured English immersion program, nearly all of the classroom
instruction shall be provided in English, but with the curriculum and presentation designed for students who are
learning English. (Education Code 305-306; 5 CCR 11309)
For the purpose of determining the amount of instruction to be conducted in English in the structured English
immersion program, "nearly all" means that all classroom instruction shall be conducted in English except for
clarification, explanation, and support as needed.
In addition, language acquisition programs offered by the district may include, but are not limited to, the
following: (Education Code 305-306)
1. A dual-language immersion program that provides integrated language learning and academic instruction for
native speakers of English and native speakers of another language, with the goals of high academic
achievement, first and second language proficiency, and cross-cultural understanding
 
2. A transitional or developmental program for English learners that provides literacy and academic instruction in
English and a student's native language and that enables an English learner to achieve English proficiency and
academic mastery of subject matter content and higher order thinking skills, including critical thinking, in order
to meet state academic content standards
The district's language acquisition programs for grades K-3 shall comply with class size requirements specified in
Education Code 42238.02. (Education Code 310)
In establishing the district's language acquisition programs, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with
parents/guardians and the community during the LCAP development process. The Superintendent or designee shall
also consult with administrators, teachers, and other personnel with appropriate authorizations and experience in
establishing a language acquisition program. (Education Code 305)
At the beginning of each school year or upon a student's enrollment, parents/guardians shall be provided information
on the types of language acquisition programs available to students enrolled in the district, including, but not limited
to, a description of each program, the process to be followed in making a program selection, identification of any
language to be taught in addition to English when the program includes instruction in another language, and the
process to request establishment of a language acquisition program. (Education Code 310; 5 CCR 11310)
Whenever a student is identified as an English learner based on the results of the ELPAC, the student's
parents/guardians may choose a language acquisition program that best suits their child. To the extent possible, any
language acquisition program requested by the parents/guardians of 30 or more students at the school or by the
parents/guardians of 20 or more students at any grade level shall be offered by the school. (Education Code 310; 5
CCR 11311)
Reclassification
When an English learner is determined based on state and district reclassification criteria to have acquired a
reasonable level of English proficiency pursuant to Education Code 313 and 52164.6, or upon request by the
student's parent/guardian, the student shall be transferred from a language acquisition program into an English
language mainstream classroom.
Program Evaluation

Policy Reference Disclaimer:
To evaluate the effectiveness of the district's educational program for English learners, the Superintendent or
designee shall report to the Board, at least annually, regarding:

3. The number and percentage of English learners who are or are at risk of being classified as long-term English
