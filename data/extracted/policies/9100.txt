Annual Organizational Meeting
Each year, the Governing Board shall hold an annual organizational meeting. In any year in which a regular election of
district Board members is conducted, the organizational meeting shall be held within 15 days following the second
Friday in December after the regular election. During all other years, the meeting may be held on any date in
December, but no later than December 20th. (Education Code 35143) During any year in which a regular election is
conducted, the Board, at the regular meeting held immediately prior to the second Friday in December, shall select
the day and time of the organizational meeting. For any other year, the day and time of the organizational meeting
shall be selected at the last regular meeting held immediately before the annual meeting.
On behalf of the Board, the Superintendent shall notify the County Superintendent of Schools of the day and time
selected. Within 15 days prior to the date of the annual meeting, the Superintendent shall notify in writing all Board
members and members-elect of the date and time selected for the meeting. (Education Code 35143)
At this meeting the Board shall:
1. Assign the following officers through rotation: President (1), Vice President (2), Clerk (3), Representative to San
Mateo County Committee on School District Organization (4), and Liaison to California School Boards
Association and the San Mateo County School Boards Association (5)
2. Appoint the Superintendent as secretary to the Board

Rotation of Officers
At the annual organizational meeting, the Board of Education shall rotate so that each current and re-elected Board
member assumes the next higher position in the officer rotation order. Newly elected or appointed board members
shall occupy the remaining vacant positions. If there is more than one new board member elected or appointed,
there will be a lottery to determine the order of filling the board positions.
The rotation shall proceed as follows:
The outgoing President (1) shall become the Liaison to the California School Boards Association (CSBA) and the San
Mateo County School Boards Association (SMCSBA) (5), unless that position is filled by a newly elected or appointed
board member; then the President would become the Representative to San Mateo County Committee on School
District Organization (4) or the next higher position. The Clerk (3) becomes Vice President (2); the Vice President
becomes President (1).
