The Board of Education recognizes that effective district governance requires strong collaboration and teamwork
with the Superintendent. Because the Board and Superintendent each have their unique roles and responsibilities,
both contribute to the responsible governance of the district and the quality of education provided to the
community's students.
The Superintendent is expected to hold himself/herself to the highest standards of ethical conduct and
professionalism.
To support the Board in the governance of the district, the Superintendent:
1. Promotes the success of all students and supports the efforts of the Board to keep the district focused on
learning and achievement
 
2. Values, advocates and supports public education and all stakeholders
 
3. Recognizes and respects the differences of perspective and style on the Board and among staff, students,
parents/guardians and the community and ensures that the diverse range of views inform Board decisions
 
4. Acts with dignity, treats everyone with civility and respect, and understands the implications of demeanor and
behavior
 
5. Serves as a model for the value of lifelong learning and supports the Board's continuous professional
development
 
6. Works with the Board as a "governance team" and assures collective responsibility for building a unity of
purpose, communicating a common vision and creating a positive organizational culture
 
7. Recognizes that the Board/Superintendent governance relationship is supported by the management team in
the district
 
8. Understands the distinctions between Board and staff roles, and respects the role of the Board as the
representative of the community
 
9. Understands that authority rests with the Board as a whole; provides guidance to the Board to assist in
decision-making; and provides leadership based on the direction of the Board as a whole
 
10. Communicates openly with trust and integrity, including providing all members of the Board with equal access
to information and recognizing the importance of both responsive and anticipatory communications
 
11. Accepts leadership responsibility and accountability for implementing the vision, goals and policies of the
district
