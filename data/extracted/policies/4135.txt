school or other charitable organizations shall be conducted in accordance with applicable Board policy and
administrative regulation.

district employees to secure information such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers for
solicitations or use in personal profit-making or beneficial ventures.
Educational tours may be promoted on school premises only if they are sponsored by the district. Employees
engaged in planning, organizing or leading tours as private, non-district-sponsored businesses shall make it clear that
they do not represent the school or district. All activities related to such tours must be carried on outside of school
hours and off school premises.
Staff participation in "flower funds," "anniversary funds" or other similar funds shall be voluntary.
