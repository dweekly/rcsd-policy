The Governing Board is committed to providing a safe work environment that is free of harassment and
intimidation. The Board prohibits sexual harassment against district employees and retaliatory behavior or
action against any person who complains, testifies, or otherwise participates in the complaint process
established for the purpose of this policy.
Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to, harassment that is based on the sex, gender, gender
identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation of the victim and harassment based on pregnancy,
childbirth, or related medical conditions.
This policy shall apply to all district employees, interns, volunteers, contractors, job applicants, and other
persons with an employment relationship with the district.
The Superintendent or designee shall take all actions necessary to ensure the prevention, investigation, and
correction of sexual harassment, including but not limited to:
1. Providing training to employees in accordance with law and administrative regulation
2. Publicizing and disseminating the district's sexual harassment policy to employees and others to
whom the policy may apply
3. Ensuring prompt, thorough, and fair investigation of complaints
4. Taking timely and appropriate corrective/remedial action(s), which may require interim separation
of the complainant and the alleged harasser and subsequent monitoring of developments
The Superintendent or designee shall periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the district's strategies to
prevent and address harassment. Such evaluation may involve conducting regular anonymous employee
surveys to assess whether harassment is occurring or is perceived to be tolerated, partnering with
researchers or other agencies with the needed expertise to evaluate the district's prevention strategies, and
using any other effective tool for receiving feedback on systems and/or processes. As necessary, changes
shall be made to the harassment policy, complaint procedures, or training.
All complaints and allegations of sexual harassment shall be kept confidential to the extent necessary to
carry out the investigation or to take other subsequent necessary actions. (2 CCR 11023)
Sexual Harassment Reports and Complaints
Any district employee who feels they have been sexually harassed in the performance of their district
responsibilities or who has knowledge of any incident of sexual harassment by or against another employee
shall immediately report the incident to their direct supervisor, a district administrator, or the district's Title
IX Coordinator. Employees may bypass their supervisor in filing a complaint if the supervisor is the subject of
the complaint. A supervisor or administrator who receives a harassment complaint shall promptly notify the
Title IX Coordinator. A supervisor or administrator who receives a harassment complaint shall promptly
notify the Title IX coordinator.
Once notified, the Title IX Coordinator shall ensure the complaint or allegation is addressed through AR
4119.12/4219.12/4319.12 - Title IX Sexual Harassment Complaint Procedures or AR 4030 -
Nondiscrimination in Employment as applicable. Complaints of sexual harassment shall be filed in accordance
with the complaint procedure specified in AR 4030 - Nondiscrimination in Employment. An employee may
bypass their supervisor in filing a complaint where the supervisor is the subject of the complaint. Because a
complaint or allegation that is dismissed or denied under the Title IX complaint procedure may still be subject
to consideration under state law, the Title IX Coordinator shall ensure that any implementation of AR
4119.12/4219.12/4319.12 concurrently meets the requirements of AR 4030.



The Title IX Coordinator shall offer supportive measures to the complainant and respondent, as deemed
appropriate under the circumstances. 
Upon investigation of a sexual harassment complaint, any district employee found to have engaged or
participated in sexual harassment or to have aided, abetted, incited, compelled, or coerced another to
commit sexual harassment in violation of this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including
dismissal, in accordance with law and the applicable collective bargaining agreement.
