The Board of Education recognizes the harmful effects of bullying on student well-being, student learning and school
attendance and desires to provide a safe school environment that protects students from physical and emotional
harm.
The district shall ensure school personnel will address any complaint alleging the occurrence of unlawful
discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment, intimidation, or bullying) against any student by another student,
employee, or other person participating in district programs and activities, including, but not limited to, those
programs or activities funded directly by or that receive or benefit from any state financial assistance, based on the
person's actual or perceived characteristics of race or ethnicity, color, ancestry, nationality, national origin, actual or
perceived citizenship or immigration status, ethnic group identification, age, religion, marital, pregnancy, or parental
status, physical or mental disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, or genetic
information, or any other characteristic identified in Education Code 200 or 220, Government Code 11135, or Penal
Code 422.55, or based on their association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived
characteristics. (5 CCR 4610)
No individual or group shall, through physical, written, verbal, visual or other means, harass, sexually harass, threaten,
intimidate, cyberbully, cause bodily injury to, or commit hate violence against any student or school personnel, or
retaliate against them for filing a complaint or participating in the complaint resolution process.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop strategies for addressing bullying in district schools with the
involvement of students, parents/guardians, and staff. As appropriate, the Superintendent or designee may also
collaborate with social services, mental health services, other agencies, and community organizations in the
development and implementation of effective strategies to promote safety in schools and the community.
Such strategies shall be incorporated into the comprehensive safety plan and, to the extent possible, into the local
control and accountability plan and other applicable district and school plans.
Any student who engages in bullying on school premises, or off campus in a manner that causes or is likely to cause a
substantial disruption of a school activity or school attendance, shall be subject to discipline, which may include
suspension or expulsion, in accordance with district policies and regulations.
Any employee who permits or engages in bullying or retaliation related to bullying shall be subject to disciplinary
action, up to and including dismissal.
