================================================================================

The Governing Board believes that, in order to maximize student learning, achievement, and well-being, certificated staff
members must be continuously learning and improving relevant skills. The Superintendent or designee shall develop a
program of ongoing professional development which includes opportunities for teachers to enhance their instructional and
classroom management skills become informed about changes in pedagogy and subject matter, and strengthen practices
related to social-emotional development and learning.
The Superintendent or designee shall involve teachers, site and district administrators, and others, as appropriate, when
creating, reviewing, and amending the district's staff development program. They shall ensure that the district's staff
development program is aligned with district priorities for student learning, achievement and well-being, school improvement
objectives, the local control and accountability plan, and other district and school plans.
The district's staff development program shall assist certificated staff in developing knowledge and skills, including, but not
limited to:
1. Mastery of subject-matter knowledge, including current state and district academic standards
 
2. Use of effective, subject-specific teaching methods, strategies, and skills
 
3. The use of technologies to enhance instruction and learning, including face-to-face, remote, or hybrid instruction
 
4. Sensitivity to and ability to meet the needs of diverse student populations, including, but not limited to, students with
characteristics specified in Education Code 200 and/or 220, Government Code 11135, and/or Penal Code 422.55
 
5. Understanding of how academic and career technical instruction can be integrated and implemented to increase
student learning
 
6. Knowledge of strategies that encourage parents/guardians to participate fully and effectively in their children's
education
 
7. Effective classroom management skills and strategies for establishing a climate that promotes respect, fairness,
tolerance and discipline, including conflict resolution, hatred prevention, and positive behavioral interventions and
supports
 
8. Ability to relate to students, understand their various stages of growth and development, and motivate them to learn
 
9. Ability to interpret and use data and assessment results to guide instruction
 
10. Knowledge of topics related to employee health, safety, and security
The Superintendent or designee shall, in conjunction with teachers, interns, and administrators, as appropriate, develop an
individualized program of professional growth to increase competence, performance, and effectiveness in teaching and
classroom management and, as necessary, to assist them in meeting state or federal requirements to be fully qualified for
their positions.
Professional learning opportunities offered by the district shall be evaluated based on the criteria specified in Education
Code 44277. Such opportunities may be part of a coherent plan that combines school activities within a school, including
lesson study or co-teaching, and external learning opportunities that are related to academic subjects taught, provide time to
meet and work with other teachers, and support instruction and student learning. Learning activities may include, but are not
limited to, mentoring projects for new teachers, extra support for teachers to improve practice, and collaboration time for
teachers to develop new instructional lessons, select or develop common formative assessments, or analyze student data.
(Education Code 44277)
The district's staff evaluation process may be used to recommend additional staff development for individual employees.
The Board may budget funds for actual and reasonable expenses incurred by staff who participate in staff development
activities.
