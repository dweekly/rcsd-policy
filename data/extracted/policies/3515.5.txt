================================================================================

In order to protect students while they are traveling to and from school, or attending school or a school-related
activity, the Governing Board believes it is important that the district responds appropriately when a law
enforcement agency notifies the district about registered sex offenders who may reside or work within district
boundaries.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish an ongoing relationship with law enforcement officials to coordinate
the receipt and dissemination of such information. To the extent authorized by law, the Superintendent or designee
also shall establish procedures for notifying appropriate staff as necessary.
Any district employee to whom sex offender information is disclosed by a law enforcement entity shall disclose the
information only when authorized by the law enforcement entity and in the manner authorized.
The Superintendent or designee may annually notify parents/guardians of the availability of information about
registered sex offenders on the Department of Justice's Megan's Law website.
Role of District Police/Security Department
In accordance with law, Board policy and administrative regulation, the district police/security department may
disseminate information about registered sex offenders to the school community. The district police/security
department shall consult with local law enforcement and the Superintendent or designee prior to any such
dissemination.
When a registered sex offender's email address or username used for instant messaging or social networking or other
internet identifier, as defined in Penal Code 290.024, is submitted to the district police/security department, such
information shall only be used by the department or released to another law enforcement entity for the purpose of
investigating a sex-related crime, a kidnapping, or human trafficking. No other disclosure shall be made or authorized
by the department, except as required by a court order. (Penal Code 290.45)
The district police/security department shall maintain records of the means and dates of dissemination for five
years. (Penal Code 290.45)
