================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that tuberculosis poses a public health threat. Treatment of active cases of this
disease is the most effective means of controlling its spread.
The number of tuberculosis cases in our county is on the rise. The County Public Health Officer therefore requires
tuberculosis testing, and follow-up if appropriate, before students enter school.
The Superintendent or designee may require a tuberculosis skin test when qualified medical personnel reasonably
suspect that a student has active tuberculosis. If there is an outbreak of tuberculosis at any school, the
Superintendent or designee may require all students at the school to undergo tuberculosis skin tests.
Students known to have had a positive tuberculosis skin test shall be excluded from school until they provide
evidence of a follow-up x-ray and appropriate medical care or are no longer suspected of having active tuberculosis.
All district staff shall receive information on how tuberculosis is spread and how it can be prevented and treated.
