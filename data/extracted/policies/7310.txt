The Redwood City School District (RCSD) Board of Education recognizes that the official name selected for any
district facility, school or any part of a school such as classrooms, libraries, offices, band rooms, stadiums, etc., is a
vital factor in the public image of the school. Therefore, the first consideration of the Board of Education in name
selections shall be the honor and integrity that the name will reflect upon the school.
The following guidelines shall control the selection of names for schools and other district-owned or leased buildings,
grounds, and facilities. No facility shall be named after a current, full-time or part-time employee.
Naming Schools
The Board encourages community participation in the process of selecting names. The principal shall appoint two
parents, two local school representatives, and two independent local residents to form a citizen advisory committee.
This committee will be charged with the task of receiving and screening name suggestions and developing a list of
recommended names to submit to the Superintendent. The Board members and Superintendent will be provided
with the full list of suggestions.
The committee will give consideration to:
1. Deceased individuals who have made a significant social contribution at the local, state or national level. If an
individual name is proposed, only the last name will symbolize the official name.
 
2. Names of communities or geographic locations served by the school, including roads and landmarks.
 
3. Other meaningful names reflecting the school's vision and mission.
Since naming a facility is an important community matter, citizens advisory committee may solicit ideas from the
general community, parents/guardians, and students of the facility, and district employees (including administrators
and teachers).
The committee will choose two or three names to be submitted to the Superintendent. The Superintendent will then
make a recommendation to the Board of Education. The Board of Education should approve the name by a majority
vote.
Any name adopted for any new school shall not be so similar to the name of any existing district school as to result in
confusion to members of the community.
Before adopting any proposed name, the Board shall hold a public hearing at which members of the public will be
given an opportunity to provide input.
Naming Local School Facilities
When the naming of a local school facility (stadium, field, library, e.g.) is proposed at the local school level, the
following process will be followed:
1. The principal shall recommend the name to the school's School Site Council.
 
2. The School Site Council shall recommend the name to the Superintendent.
 
3. The Superintendent shall recommend the name to the Board of Education.
 
4. The Board of Education shall approve the name by a majority vote.
The committee will give consideration to deceased individuals who have made a significant social contribution. If an
individual name is proposed, only the last name will symbolize the official name. Names of communities or
geographic locations served by the school, including roads and landmarks shall also be considered, as well as other
meaningful names reflecting the school's vision and mission.
Renaming Facilities



In the event a facility is no longer used as a school, the following process will be followed:
1. A committee with a minimum of three administrative staff shall be appointed by the Superintendent and
charged with the task of developing a list of recommended names for the facility.
 
2. The recommended names shall be submitted to the Superintendent.
 
3. The Superintendent will then make a recommendation to the Board of Education.
 
4. The Board of Education shall approve the name by a majority vote.
Consideration should be given to names related to the function or specialty of the particular facility and/or
individuals who have made a significant social contribution.
If an individual name is proposed, only the last name will symbolize the official name. Names of communities or
geographic locations served by the school, including roads and landmarks shall also be considered.
In the event a school or program is moved to a different facility, the following process will be followed:
The Superintendent can recommend to the Board of Education that the school keep the same name at its new
facility.
The Board of Education shall approve the name by a majority vote.
Any name adopted for any new school shall not be so similar to the name of any existing district school as to result in
confusion to members of the community.
Before adopting any proposed name, the Board shall hold a public hearing at which members of the public will be
given an opportunity to provide input.
Memorials
Upon request, the Board of Education shall consider planting commemorative trees, erecting monuments, or
dedicating buildings, parts of buildings, athletic fields, gardens, or other district facilities, in memory of deceased
students, staff members, community members, and benefactors of the district.
Naming Rights
The Board of Education may grant to any person or entity the right to name any district facility. In doing so, the
Board of Education shall enter into a written agreement that shall:
1. Specify the benefits to the district from entering into the agreement.
 
2. State the roles and responsibilities of the parties to the agreement, including whether or not the Board of
Education shall retain the power to approve any proposed name.
 
3. Provide details related to the naming right granted, including the building, grounds, or facility involved and the
duration for which the name shall be in effect.
 
4. Prohibit any message, image, or other depiction that advocates or endorses the use of drugs, tobacco, or
alcohol, encourages unlawful discrimination against any person or group, or promotes the use of violence or
the violation of any law or district policy.
 
5. Reserve the authority to terminate the naming right if it determines that the grantee, subsequent to receiving
the naming right, has engaged in any of the prohibited acts stated in item #4 above or other criminal or
unlawful acts that might bring the district into disrepute.
