Agenda Content
Governing Board meeting agendas shall reflect the district's vision and goals and the Board's focus on
student learning and well-being. Each agenda shall state the meeting time and location and shall briefly
describe each item to be transacted or discussed, including items to be discussed in closed session. 
(Government Code 54954.2)
The agenda shall provide members of the public the opportunity to address the Board on any agenda item
before or during the Board's consideration of the item. However, the agenda need not provide an
opportunity for public comment when the agenda item has previously been considered at an open meeting
by a committee comprised exclusively of Board members, provided that members of the public were
afforded an opportunity to comment on the item, before or during the committee's consideration of the item,
and the item has not been substantially changed since the committee considered it. (Government Code
54954.3)
The agenda for a regular Board meeting shall also provide members of the public an opportunity to provide
comment on matters which are not on the agenda but which are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the
Board. (Education Code 35145.5; Government Code 54954.3)
Each agenda for a regular meeting shall list the address designated by the Superintendent or designee for
public inspection of documents related to an open session item that have been distributed to the Board less
than 72 hours before the meeting. (Government Code 54957.5)
The agenda shall include information regarding how, when, and to whom a request for disability-related
accommodations or modifications, including auxiliary aids and services, may be made by an individual who
requires accommodations or modifications in order to participate in the Board meeting. (Government Code
54954.2)
Agenda Preparation
The Board president and the Superintendent, as secretary to the Board, shall work together to develop the
agenda for each regular and special meeting. Each agenda shall reflect the district's vision and goals and the
Board's focus on student learning.
Any Board member or member of the public may request that a matter within the jurisdiction of the Board
be placed on the agenda of a regular meeting. The request shall be submitted in writing to the
Superintendent or designee with supporting documents and information, if any, at least ten days before the
scheduled meeting date. Items submitted less than ten days before the scheduled meeting date may be
postponed to a later meeting in order to allow sufficient time for consideration and research of the issue.
The Board president and Superintendent shall decide whether a request from a member of the public is
within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board. Items not within the subject matter jurisdiction of the
Board may not be placed on the agenda. In addition, before placing the item on the agenda, the Board
president and Superintendent shall determine if the item is merely a request for information, and if so,
respond accordingly.
If the Board president and Superintendent deny a request from a Board member to place an item on the
agenda, the Board member may request the Board to take action to determine whether the item shall be
placed on the agenda.
The Board president and Superintendent shall also decide whether an agenda item is appropriate for
discussion in open or closed session, and whether the item should be an action item subject to Board vote or
an information item that does not require immediate action.
Board Policy Manual
Redwood City School District

In order to promote efficient meetings, the Board may bundle a number of items and act upon them together
by a single vote through the use of a consent agenda. Consent items shall be items of a routine nature and
items for which Board discussion is not anticipated and for which the Superintendent recommends approval.
When any Board member requests the removal of an item from the consent agenda, the item shall be
removed and given individual consideration for action as a regular agenda item.
The agenda shall provide an opportunity for members of the public to comment on any consent agenda item
unless such item has been previously considered at an open meeting of a committee comprised exclusively
of Board members. (Government Code 54954.3)
Any Board action that involves borrowing $100,000 or more shall be discussed, considered, and deliberated
upon as a separate item of business on the meeting agenda. (Government Code 53635.7)
All public communications with the Board are subject to requirements of relevant Board policies and
administrative regulations.
Agenda Dissemination to Board Members
At least 72 hours before each regular meeting, a copy of the agenda and agenda packet shall be provided to
each Board member, including the Superintendent or designee's report; minutes to be approved; copies of
communications; reports from committees, staff, and others; and other available supporting documents
pertinent to the meeting.
When special meetings are called, Board members shall receive, at least 24 hours prior to the meeting, notice
of the business to be transacted.
Board members shall review agenda materials before each meeting. Individual members may confer directly
with the Superintendent or designee to ask questions and/or request additional information on agenda
items. However, a majority of Board members shall not, outside of a noticed meeting, directly or through
intermediaries or electronic means discuss, deliberate, or take action on any matter within the subject matter
jurisdiction of the Board.
Agenda Dissemination to Members of the Public
Any agenda and related materials distributed to the Board shall be made available to the public upon request
without delay. Only those documents which are disclosable public records under the Public Records Act
(PRA) and which relate to an agenda item scheduled for the open session portion of a regular meeting shall
be made available to the public. (Government Code 54957.5)
At least 72 hours prior to a regular meeting, the agenda shall be posted at one or more locations freely
accessible to members of the public. (Government Code 54954.2)
In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall post the document on the district's web site. The posted
agenda shall be accessible through a prominent direct link to the current agenda or to the district's agenda
management platform in accordance with Government Code 54954.2. When the district utilizes an
integrated agenda management platform, the link to that platform shall take the user directly to the web site
with the district's agendas, and the current agenda shall be the first available (Government Code 54957.5)
If a document which relates to an open session agenda item of a regular Board meeting is distributed to the
Board less than 72 hours prior to a meeting, the Superintendent or designee shall make the document
available for public inspection at a designated location at the same time the document is distributed to all or
a majority of the Board.
Any documents prepared by the district or the Board and distributed during a public meeting shall be made
available for public inspection at the meeting. Any documents prepared by another person shall be made
available for public inspection after the meeting. These requirements shall not apply to a document that is
exempt from public disclosure under the Public Records Act. (Government Code 54957.5)

Policy Reference Disclaimer:
The Superintendent or designee shall mail a copy of the agenda or a copy of all the documents constituting
the agenda packet to any person who requests the items. The materials shall be mailed at the time the
agenda is posted or upon distribution of the agenda to a majority of the Board, whichever occurs first. 
(Government Code 54954.1). The agenda may also be emailed to individuals who request an electronic
agenda.
Any request for mailed copies of agendas or agenda packets shall be in writing and shall be valid for the
calendar year in which it is filed. Written requests must be renewed following January 1 of each year.
(Government Code 54954.1)
Persons requesting mailing of the agenda or agenda packet shall pay an annual fee, as determined by the
Superintendent or designee, not to exceed the cost of providing the service.
Any document prepared by the district or Board and distributed during a public meeting shall be made
available for public inspection at the meeting. Any document prepared by another person shall be made
available for public inspection after the meeting. These requirements shall not apply to a document that is
exempt from public disclosure under the Public Records Act (PRA). (Government Code 54957.5)
Upon request, the Superintendent or designee shall make the agenda, agenda packet, and/or any writings
distributed at the meeting available in appropriate alternative formats to persons with a disability, as required
by the Americans with Disabilities Act. (Government Code 54954.1)
