================================================================================

This Debt Issuance and Management Policy provides a framework for debt management and capital planning by the
Redwood City School District.
The Board of Education is committed to long-term capital and financial planning and recognizes that the issuance of
debt is a key source for funding the improvement and maintenance of school facilities and managing cash flow. Any
debt issued by the district shall be consistent with law and this policy.
The district shall not enter into indebtedness or liability that in any year exceeds the income and revenue provided
for such year, unless two-thirds of the voters approve the obligation or one of the exceptions specified in law
applies. (California Constitution, Article 16, Section 18).
When the Board determines that it is in the best interest of the district, the Board may issue debt or order an
election to issue debt. The Superintendent or designee shall make recommendations to the Board regarding
appropriate financing methods for capital projects or other projects that are authorized purposes for debt issuance.
When approved by the Board and/or the voters as applicable, the Superintendent or designee shall administer and
coordinate the district's debt issuance program and activities, including the timing of issuance, sizing of issuance,
method of sale, structuring of the issue, and marketing strategies.
Financial Advisors
The Superintendent or designee shall retain a financial advisor, municipal advisor, investment advisor, and other
financial services professionals as needed to assist with the structuring of the debt issuance and to provide general
advice on the district's debt management program, financing options, investments, and compliance with legal
requirements. Contracts for services provided by such advisors may be for a single transaction or for multiple
transactions, consistent with the contracting requirements in Education Code 17596. In the event that the district
issues debt through a negotiated sale, underwriters may be selected for multiple transactions if multiple issuances
are planned for the same project. In addition, the district shall select a legal team on an as-needed basis to assist with
debt issuances or special projects.
Goals of Debt Issuance and Management Policy
The district's debt issuance activities and procedures shall be aligned with the district's vision and goals for providing
adequate facilities and programs that support student learning and well-being. When issuing debt, the district shall
ensure that it:
1. Maintains accountability for the fiscal health of the district, including prudent management and transparency of
the district's financing programs
 
2. If applicable, pursues the best possible credit rating for each debt issue in order to reduce interest costs, within
the context of preserving financial flexibility and meeting capital funding requirements
 
3. Takes all practical precautions and proactive measures to avoid any financial decision that will negatively
impact current credit ratings on existing or future debt issues
 
4. Maintains effective communication with rating agencies and, as appropriate, credit enhancers such as bond
insurers or other providers of credit or liquidity instruments in order to enhance the creditworthiness, liquidity,
or marketability of the debt
 
5. Monitors the district's statutory debt limit in relation to assessed valuation within the district and the tax
burden needed to meet long-term debt service requirements
 
6. When determining the timing of debt issuance, considers market conditions, cash flows associated with
repayment, and the district's ability to expend the obtained funds in a timely, efficient, and economical manner
consistent with federal tax laws
 
7. Determines the amortization (maturity) schedule which will fit best within the overall debt structure of the
district at the time the new debt is issued

8. Considers the useful lives of assets funded by the debt issue, as well as repair and replacement costs of those
assets to be incurred in the future
 
9. Preserves the availability of the district's general fund for operating purposes and other purposes that cannot
be funded by the issuance of voter-approved debt
 
10. Meets the ongoing obligations and accountability requirements associated with the issuance and management
of debt under state and federal tax and securities laws
Authorized Purposes for the Issuance of Debt
The district may issue debt for any of the following purposes:
1. To pay for the cost of capital improvements, including acquiring, constructing, reconstructing, rehabilitating,
replacing, improving, extending, enlarging, and/or equipping district facilities
 
2. To refund existing debt
 
3. To provide for cash flow needs
Operating Cash Flow
Pursuant to Government Code 53854, general operating costs, including, but not limited to, items normally funded in
the district's annual operating budget, shall not be financed from debt payable later than 15 months from the date of
issuance. The district may deem it desirable to finance cash flow requirements under certain conditions so that
available resources better match expenditures within a given fiscal year. To satisfy both state constitutional and
statutory constraints, such cash flow borrowing shall be payable from taxes, income, revenue, cash receipts, and
other moneys attributable to the fiscal year in which the debt is issued.
Authorized Types of Debt
The Superintendent or designee shall recommend to the Board potential financing method(s) that result in the
highest benefit to the district, with the cost of staff and consultants considered. Potential financing sources may
include:
1. Short-Term Debt
 
a. Short-term debt, such as tax and revenue anticipation notes (TRANs), when necessary to allow the
district to meet its cash flow requirements (Government Code 53850-53858)
 
b. Bond anticipation notes (BANs) to provide interim financing for capital bond projects that will ultimately
be paid from general obligation bonds (Education Code 15150)
 
c. Grant anticipation notes (GANs) to provide interim financing pending the receipt of grants and/or loans
from the state or federal government that have been appropriated and committed to the district
(Government Code 53859-53859.08)
 
2. Long-Term Debt
 
a. General obligation bonds for projects approved by voters (California Constitution, Article 13A, Section 1;
Education Code 15100-15262, 15264- 15276; Government Code 53506-53509.5)
 
b. Special tax bonds issued pursuant to the Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982 (Government
Code 53311-53368.3)
 
3. Lease financing, including certificates of participation (COPs) and lease revenue bonds
 
a. Lease financing to fund the highest priority capital equipment purchases when pay-as-you-go financing
is not feasible (Education Code 17450-17453.1)
 
b. Lease financing to fund facilities projects when there is insufficient time to obtain voter approval or in
instances where obtaining voter approval is either not feasible or unavailable (Education Code
17400-17429)

4. Special financing programs or structures offered by the federal or state government, such as Qualified Zone
Academy Bonds or other tax credit obligations or obligations that provide subsidized interest payments, when
the use of such programs or structures is determined to result in sufficiently lower financing costs compared to
traditional tax-exempt bonds and/or COPs or revenue bonds
 
5. Temporary borrowing from other sources such as the County Treasurer
COPs, TRANs, revenue bonds, or any other non-voter approved debt instrument shall not be issued by the district in
any fiscal year in which the district has a qualified or negative certification, unless the County Superintendent of
Schools determines, pursuant to criteria established by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, that the district's
repayment of that indebtedness is probable. (Education Code 42133)
Relationship of Debt to District Facilities Program and Budget
Decisions regarding the issuance of debt for the purpose of financing capital improvement shall be aligned with
current needs for acquisition, development, and/or improvement of district property and facilities as identified in the
district's facilities master plan or other applicable needs assessment, the projected costs of those needs, schedules
for the projects, and the expected resources.
The cost of debt issued for major capital repairs or replacements shall be evaluated against the potential cost of
delaying such repairs and/or replacing such facilities.
When considering a debt issuance, the Board and the Superintendent or designee shall evaluate both the short-term
and long-term implications of the debt issuance and additional operating costs associated with the new projects
involved. Such evaluation may include, but is not limited to, the projected ratio of annual debt service to the tax
burden on the district's taxpayers and the ratio of annual debt service secured by the general fund to general fund
expenditures.
The district may enter into credit enhancement agreements such as municipal bond insurance, surety bonds, letters
of credit, and lines of credit with commercial banks, municipal bond insurance companies, or other financial entities
when their use is judged to lower borrowing costs, eliminate restrictive covenants, or have a net economic benefit to
the financing.
Structure of Debt Issues
The district shall consider the overall impact of the current and future debt burden of the financing when
determining the duration of the debt issue.
The district shall design the financing schedule and repayment of debt so as to take best advantage of market
conditions, ensure cost effectiveness, provide flexibility, and, as practical, recapture or maximize its debt capacity for
future use. Principal amortization will be structured to meet debt repayment, tax rate, and flexibility goals.
For new money debt issuances for capital improvements, the district shall size the debt issuance with the aim of
funding capital projects as deemed appropriate by the Board, as long as the issuance is consistent with the overall
financing plan, does not exceed the amount authorized by voters, and, unless a waiver is sought and received from
the state, will not cause the district to exceed the limitation on debt issuances specified in the California Constitution
or Education Code 15106.
To the extent practicable, the district shall also consider credit issues, market factors, and tax law when sizing the
district's bond issuance. The sizing of refunding bonds shall be determined by the amount of money that will be
required to cover the principal of, any accrued interest on, and any redemption premium for the debt to be paid on
the call date and to cover appropriate financing costs.
Any general obligation bond issued by the district shall mature within 40 years of the issuance date or as otherwise
required by law. (California Constitution, Article 16, Section 18; Government Code 53508.6)
The final maturity of equipment or real property lease obligations will be limited to the useful life of the assets to be
financed but, with respect to a lease purchase of equipment, no longer than a period of 10 years. (Education Code
17452)
Method of Sale
For the sale of any district-issued debt, the Superintendent or designee shall recommend the method of sale with the

potential to achieve the lowest financing cost and/or to generate other benefits to the district. Potential methods of
sale include:
1. A competitive bidding process through which the award is based on, among other factors, the lowest offered
true interest cost
 
2. Negotiated sale, subject to approval by the district to ensure that interest costs are in accordance with
comparable market interest rates
 
3. Private placement sale, when the financing can or must be structured for a single or limited number of
purchasers or where the terms of the private placement are more beneficial to the district than either a
negotiated or competitive sale
Investment of Proceeds
The district shall actively manage the proceeds of debt issued for public purposes in a manner that is consistent with
state law governing the investment of public funds and with the permitted securities covenants of related financing
documents executed by the district. Where applicable, the district's official investment policy and legal documents
for a particular debt issuance shall govern specific methods of investment of bond-related proceeds. Preservation of
principal shall be the primary goal of any investment strategy, followed by the availability of funds and then by return
on investment.
With regard to general obligation bonds, the district shall invest new money bond proceeds in the county treasury
pool as required by law. (Education Code 15146)
The management of public funds shall enable the district to respond to changes in markets or changes in payment or
construction schedules so as to ensure liquidity and minimize risk.
Refunding/Restructuring
The district may consider refunding or restructuring outstanding debt if it will be financially advantageous or
beneficial for debt repayment and/or structuring flexibility. When doing so, the district shall consider the
maximization of the district's expected net savings over the life of the debt issuance and, when using a general
obligation bond to refund an existing bond, shall ensure that the final maturity of the refunding bond is no longer
than the final maturity of the existing bond.
Internal Controls
The Superintendent or designee shall establish internal control procedures to ensure that the proceeds of any debt
issuance are directed to the intended use. Such procedures shall assist the district in maintaining the effectiveness
and efficiency of operations, properly expending funds, reliably reporting debt incurred by the district and the use of
the proceeds, complying with all laws and regulations, preventing fraud, and avoiding conflict of interest.
The district shall be vigilant in using bond proceeds in accordance with the stated purposes at the time such debt was
incurred as defined in the text of the voter-approved bond measure. (Government Code 53410)
When feasible, the district shall issue debt with a defined revenue source in order to preserve the use of the general
fund for general operating purposes.
The district shall annually conduct a due diligence review to ensure its compliance with all ongoing obligations
applicable to issuers of debt. Such a review may be conducted by general legal counsel or bond counsel. Any district
personnel involved in conducting such reviews shall receive periodic training regarding their responsibilities.
In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district completes, as applicable, all performance
and financial audits that may be required for any debt issued by the district, including disclosure requirements
applicable to a particular transaction.
Records/Reports
At least 30 days prior to the sale of any debt issue, the Superintendent or designee shall submit a report of the
proposed issuance to the California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission (CDIAC). Such report shall include a
self-certification that the district has adopted a policy concerning the use of debt that complies with law and that the
contemplated debt issuance is consistent with that policy. (Government Code 8855)

Policy Reference Disclaimer:
On or before January 31 of each year, the Superintendent or designee shall submit a report to the CDIAC regarding
the debt authorized, the debt outstanding, and the use of proceeds of the issued debt for the period from July 1 to
June 30. (Government Code 8855)
The Superintendent or designee shall provide initial and any annual or ongoing disclosures required by 17 CFR
240.10b-5 and 240.15c2-12 to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, investors, and other persons or entities
entitled to disclosure, and shall ensure that the district's disclosure filings are updated as needed.
The Superintendent or designee shall maintain transaction records of decisions made in connection with each debt
issuance, including the selection of members of the financing team, the structuring of the financing, selection of
credit enhancement products and providers, and selection of investment products. Each transaction file shall include
the official transcript for the financing, interest rates and cost of issuance on the day when the debt was sold ("final
number runs"), and a post-pricing summary of the debt issue. In addition, documentation evidencing the expenditure
of proceeds, the use of debt-financed property by public and private entities, all sources of payment or security for
the debt, and investment of proceeds shall be kept for as long as the debt is outstanding, plus the period ending
three years after the financial payment date of the debt or the final payment date of any obligations or series of
bonds issued to refund directly or indirectly all of any portion of the debt, whichever is later.
The Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the Board regarding debts issued by the district, including
information on actual and projected tax rates, an analysis of bonding capacity, ratings on the district's bonds, market
update and refunding opportunities, new development for California bond financings, and the district's compliance
with post-issuance requirements.
