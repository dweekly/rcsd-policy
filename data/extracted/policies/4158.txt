================================================================================

The Board of Education desires to provide a safe, orderly working environment for all employees. As part of the
district's comprehensive school safety plan, the Superintendent or designee shall develop strategies for protecting
employees from potentially dangerous persons and situations and for assisting them in the event of an emergency
situation.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that employees are informed, in accordance with law, regarding crimes
and offenses by students who may pose a danger in the classroom.
When violence is directed against an employee by any individual and the employee so notifies the Superintendent or
designee, the Superintendent or designee shall take steps to ensure that appropriate legal measures are instituted.
When the employee notifies the Superintendent or designee of a threat of bodily harm, the district shall take
appropriate measures to enable the employee to request assistance if a threat occurs on school grounds.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that employees are trained in crisis prevention and intervention
techniques in order to protect themselves and students. Staff development may include training in classroom
management, effective communication techniques and crisis resolution.
The Board recognizes that access to two-way communications devices allows employees to call for assistance from
their supervisor or law enforcement in the event of a threat of violence or medical emergency. The district shall
provide such communications devices in classrooms to the extent possible.
Reporting of Injurious Objects
The Board requires school employees to take immediate action upon being made aware that any person is in
possession of an injurious object on school grounds or at a school-related or school-sponsored activity. The
employee shall use his/her own judgment as to the dangerousness of the situation and, based upon this analysis,
shall do one of the following:
1. Confiscate the object and deliver it to the principal immediately
 
2. Immediately notify the principal, who shall take appropriate action
 
3. Immediately notify the local law enforcement agency and the principal
When informing the principal about the possession or seizure of a weapon or dangerous device, the employee shall
report the name(s) of persons involved, witnesses, location, and the circumstances of any seizure.
