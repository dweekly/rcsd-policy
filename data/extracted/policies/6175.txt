The Board of Education desires to provide a comprehensive education program for migrant students that attempts to
mitigate the impact of disruptions on their education and provides them the opportunity to meet the district's
academic standards. The district shall make use of available funds to provide supplementary services for migrant
students.
The Superintendent or designee shall plan for late enrollments of migrant students and shall ensure that all migrant
students are correctly identified and placed at the appropriate grade level. He/she shall acquire records from
students' previous school districts, as appropriate, and shall consult these records when identifying students'
comprehensive needs and preparing their individual learning plans.
When a migrant student transfers to another district, his/her records shall be provided to the receiving district upon
request at no cost in order to assist the district in meeting the needs of the student. (20 USC 6398)
The Superintendent or designee shall convene a district parent/guardian advisory council to actively involve
parents/guardians in planning, operating and evaluating the migrant education program. (Education Code 54444.2)
The Superintendent or designee shall coordinate the district's migrant program services with other public agencies
that serve migrant workers and their families.
