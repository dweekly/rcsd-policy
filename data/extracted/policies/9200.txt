The Board of Education recognizes that the Board is the unit of authority over the district and that a Board member
has no individual authority. Board members shall hold the education of students above any partisan principle, group
interest, or personal interest.
Unless agreed to by the Board as a whole, individual members of the Board shall not exercise any administrative
responsibility with respect to the schools or command the services of any school employee. Individual Board
members shall submit requests for information to the Superintendent or designated representative. Board members
shall refer Board-related correspondence to the Superintendent for forwarding to the Board or for placement on the
Board's agenda, as appropriate.
Individual Board members do not have the authority to resolve complaints. Any Board member approached directly
by a person with a complaint should refer the complainant to the Superintendent or designee so that the problem
may receive proper consideration and be handled through the appropriate district process.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide a copy of the state's open meeting laws (Brown Act) to each Board
member and to anyone who is elected to the Board but has not yet assumed office.
Board members and persons elected to the Board who have not yet assumed office are responsible for complying
with the requirements of the Brown Act. (Government Code 54952.1)
