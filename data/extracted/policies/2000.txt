================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that district administration performs essential roles and functions in support of
student learning, including the provision of instructional support and services to schools as well as the responsible
management of noninstructional operations. The Superintendent or designee may make decisions concerning district
operations within the parameters of law and Board policy.
The Superintendent shall provide leadership in developing administrative regulations and organizational structures,
decision-making processes, and staff action plans that allow the district to fulfill its vision and goals. The Board also
expects the Superintendent to help shape the culture and environment of the district in a manner that focuses
district operations on enhancing student achievement, encourages positive relationships within the community, and
instills confidence in district schools.
The Board and Superintendent shall work together as a team in the exercise of district governance. The Board and
Superintendent shall establish protocols that describe how the governance team will operate, including, but not
limited to, agreements regarding Board meeting operations and communications between the Superintendent and
the Board.
Because the Superintendent is the only district employee who is directly selected and evaluated by the Board, the
Board has a responsibility to ensure that the Superintendent possesses the skills and attributes that best meet the
needs of the district.
The Board and Superintendent shall agree upon a system for evaluating the Superintendent, including the evaluation
criteria, method, evaluation instrument, process, and timeline.
The Superintendent may delegate to other district staff any duties imposed upon him/her by the Board. This
delegation shall not relieve the Superintendent of responsibility for actions taken by his/her designees.
