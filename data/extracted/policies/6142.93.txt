Title: Science Instruction

================================================================================

The Board believes that science education should focus on promoting an attitude of inquisitiveness and inquiry while
giving students an understanding of key scientific concepts and a capacity for scientific ways of thinking. Students
should become familiar with the natural world and the interrelation of science, mathematics and technology. As part
of their science instruction, students should learn how to apply scientific knowledge and ways of thinking that
benefit both the individual and society.
Philosophical and religious theories are based, at least in part, on faith, and are not subject to scientific test and
refutation. Such beliefs shall not be discussed in science classes.
