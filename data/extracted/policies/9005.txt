The Board of Education believes that its primary responsibility is to act in the best interests of every student in the
district. The Board also has major commitments to parents/guardians, all members of the community, employees, the
state of California, laws pertaining to public education, and established policies of the district. To maximize Board
effectiveness and public confidence in district governance, Board members are expected to govern responsibly and
hold themselves to the highest standards of ethical conduct.
The Board expects its members to work with each other and the Superintendent to ensure that a high-quality
education is provided to each student. Each individual Board member shall:
1. Keep learning and achievement for all students as the primary focus
 
2. Value, support and advocate for public education
 
3. Recognize and respect differences of perspective and style on the Board and among staff, students, parents
and the community
 
4. Act with dignity, and understand the implications of demeanor and behavior
 
5. Keep confidential matters confidential
 
6. Participate in professional development and commit the time and energy necessary to be an informed and
effective leader
 
7. Understand the distinctions between Board and staff roles, and refrain from performing management functions
that are the responsibility of the Superintendent and staff
 
8. Understand that authority rests with the Board as a whole and not with individuals

culture. To operate effectively, the Board shall have a unity of purpose and:
1. Keep the district focused on learning and achievement for all students
 
2. Communicate a common vision
 
3. Operate openly, with trust and integrity
 
4. Govern in a dignified and professional manner, treating everyone with civility and respect
