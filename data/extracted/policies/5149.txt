================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that personal, social, health, and economic circumstances of children and families
sometimes place students at risk of school failure. The Board believes, however, that each student can succeed in
meeting district academic standards with appropriate educational programs and support services.
District assessments and ongoing classroom evaluations shall be used to identify students performing below grade-
level or at risk of failing to meet district standards. The Superintendent or designee shall develop strategies to
address the needs of at-risk students, which may include but are not limited to instructional strategies responsive to
the needs of individual students, provision of supplemental instruction outside the regular school day, provision of
effective support services, parent involvement, and/or enrollment in an alternative program.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that employees are trained to support students and are prepared to
implement intervention strategies as needed or to make appropriate referrals.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish a student assistance program to help coordinate the district's learning
support programs including education, prevention, early identification, intervention, referral, and support services,
into an integrated delivery system.
The district's program for at-risk students shall emphasize coordination between site, district, and community-based
programs in order to ensure effective implementation and shared accountability.

for the Governing Board to enact this policy. Instead, they are provided as additional resources for those interested in the subject matter
