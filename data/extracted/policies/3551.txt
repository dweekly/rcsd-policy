================================================================================

The Governing Board intends that school food services shall be a self-supporting, nonprofit program. To
ensure program quality and increase cost-effectiveness, the Superintendent or designee shall centralize and
direct the purchasing of food and supplies, the planning of menus, and the auditing of all food service
accounts for the district.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that food service director(s) possess the qualifications required
by 7 CFR 210.30 and California Department of Education (CDE) standards.
At least once each year, food service administrators, other appropriate personnel who conduct or oversee
administrative procedures, and other food service personnel shall receive training provided by CDE. (42 USC
1776)
Meal Sales
Meals may be sold to students, district employees, Board members, and employees or members of the fund
or association maintaining the cafeteria. (Education Code 38082)
In addition, meals may be sold to nonstudents, including parents/guardians, students' siblings volunteers, or
other individuals who are on campus for a legitimate purpose. Any meals served to nonstudents shall not be
subsidized by federal or state reimbursements, food service revenues, or U.S. Department of Agriculture
commodities.
Meal prices, as recommended by the Superintendent or designee and approved by the Board, shall be based
on the costs of providing food services and consistent with Education Code 38084 and 42 USC 1760.
Students who are enrolled in the free or reduced-price meal programs shall receive meals free of charge or at
a reduced price in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish strategies and procedures for the collection of meal payments,
including delinquent meal payments. Such procedures shall conform with BP/AR 3553 - Free and Reduced Price
Meals, 2 CFR 200.426, and any applicable CDE guidance. The Superintendent or designee shall clearly communicate
these procedures to students and parents/guardians and shall make this policy and the accompanying administrative
regulation available to the public pursuant to Education Code 49557.5.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that a student whose parent/guardian has unpaid school meal fees or a
student who is enrolled in the free or reduced-price meal program is not overtly identified by the use of special
tokens, tickets, or other means and is not shamed, treated differently, or denied a meal of the student's choice.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish a cafeteria fund independent of the district's general fund.
The wages, salaries, and benefits of food service employees shall be paid from the cafeteria fund. (Education Code
38103)
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that state and federal funds provided through school meal programs are
allocated only for purposes related to the operation or improvement of food services and reasonable and necessary
indirect program costs as allowed by law.
Contracts with Outside Services
With Board approval, the district may enter into a contract for food service consulting services or management
services in one or more district schools. (Education Code 45103.5; 42 USC 1758; 7 CFR 210.16)
Procurement of Foods, Equipment and Supplies
To the maximum extent practicable, foods purchased for use in school meals by the district or by any entity
purchasing food on its behalf shall be domestic commodities or products. Domestic commodity or product means an



agricultural commodity that is produced in the United States and a food product that is processed in the United
States substantially using agricultural commodities that are produced in the United States. (42 USC 1760; 7 CFR
210.21)
A nondomestic food product may be purchased for use in the district's food service program only as a last resort
when the product is not produced or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available
quantities of a satisfactory quality, or when competitive bids reveal the costs of a United States product are
significantly higher Business and Noninstructional Operations than the nondomestic product. In such cases, the
Superintendent or designee shall retain documentation justifying the use of the exception.
Furthermore, the district shall accept a bid or price for an agricultural product grown in California before accepting a
bid or price for an agricultural product grown outside the state, if the quality of the California-grown product is
comparable and the bid or price does not exceed the lowest bid or price of a product produced outside the state.
(Food and Agriculture Code 58595)
Bid solicitations and awards for purchases of equipment, materials, or supplies in support of the district's child
nutrition program, or for contracts awarded pursuant to Public Contract Code 2000, shall be consistent with the
federal procurement standards in 2 CFR 200.318-200.326. Awards shall be let to the most responsive and
responsible party. Price shall be the primary consideration, but not the only determining factor, in making such an
award. (Public Contract Code 20111)
Program Monitoring and Evaluation
The Superintendent or designee shall present to the Board, at least annually, financial reports regarding revenues and
expenditures related to the food service program.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide all necessary documentation required for the Administrative Review
conducted by CDE to ensure compliance of the district's food service program with federal requirements.
