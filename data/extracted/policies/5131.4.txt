================================================================================

The Board of Education desires to provide orderly campuses that create a positive school environment and are
conducive to learning. When students initiate or are involved in a campus disturbance that has the potential to
threaten the safety of students or staff, the Superintendent or designee may request law enforcement assistance.
The Superintendent or designee and the principal of each school shall establish a school disturbance response plan
that is intended to curb disruptions which may lead to riots, violence, or vandalism at school or at school-sponsored
events. In developing each school's plan, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with local law enforcement
authorities to create guidelines for law enforcement support and intervention.
Staff are encouraged to be alert to conditions at school that may lead to a disturbance, such as racial or cultural
conflict, student protests, or gang intimidation and confrontations. Staff who believe that a disturbance is imminent,
or who see a disturbance occurring, shall immediately contact the principal and invoke the school safety plan.
Students who participate in a campus disturbance shall be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with Board
policy and administrative regulations.
