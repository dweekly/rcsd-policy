The Board of Education desires to provide support systems for students with asthma in order to reduce school
absences, help ensure that such students receive appropriate intervention if symptoms occur at school, and enable
them to participate in the educational program and school activities to the extent possible.
The Superintendent or designee shall involve school nurses, other health professionals, school administrators, and
health educators in the development of strategies to help provide a healthy and safe school environment for
students with asthma. He/she may also involve school health councils or committees and other interested persons to
ensure that the district's strategies are coordinated with other school health programs and practices.
District strategies shall include, but not be limited to, procedures for identifying and addressing individual student
needs, providing effective professional development on asthma symptoms and staff responsibilities, and identifying
and reducing environmental factors at schools that may trigger and/or worsen asthma symptoms.
