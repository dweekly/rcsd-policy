================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that suicide is a leading cause of death among youth and that school personnel
who regularly interact with students are often in a position to recognize the warning signs of suicide and to offer
appropriate referral and/or assistance. In an effort to reduce suicidal behavior and its impact on students and
families, the Superintendent or designee shall develop measures and strategies for suicide prevention, intervention,
and postvention and the identification of the mental health challenges frequently associated with suicidal thinking
and behavior.
In developing measures and strategies for use by the district, the Superintendent or designee may consult with
school health professionals, school counselors, school psychologists, school social workers, administrators, other
staff, parents/guardians, students, suicide prevention experts, local health agencies, mental health professionals, and
community organizations.
Such measures and strategies shall include, but are not limited to:
1. Staff development on suicide awareness and prevention for teachers, school counselors, and other district
employees who interact with students
 
2. Instruction to students in problem-solving and coping skills to promote students' mental, emotional, and social
health and well-being, as well as instruction in recognizing and appropriately responding to warning signs of
suicidal intent in others
 
3. Methods for promoting a positive school climate that enhances students' feelings of connectedness with the
school and that is characterized by caring staff and harmonious interrelationships among students
 
4. The provision of information to parents/guardians regarding risk factors and warning signs of suicide, the
severity of the suicide problem among youth, the district's suicide prevention curriculum, basic steps for
helping suicidal youth, and/or school and community resources that can help youth in crisis
 
5. Encouragement for students to notify appropriate school personnel or other adults when they are
experiencing thoughts of suicide or when they suspect or have knowledge of another student's suicidal
intentions
 
6. Crisis intervention procedures for addressing suicide threats or attempts
 
7. Counseling and other postvention strategies for helping students, staff, and others cope in the aftermath of a
student's suicide
As appropriate, these measures and strategies shall specifically address the needs of students who are at high risk of
suicide, including, but not limited to, students who are bereaved by suicide; students with disabilities, mental illness,
or substance use disorders; students who are experiencing homelessness or who are in out-of-home settings such as
foster care; and students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning youth. (Education Code 215)
The Board shall review, and update as necessary, this policy at least every five years. (Education Code 215)
