The Board of Education recognizes that parents/guardians of district students have certain rights as well as
responsibilities related to the education of their children.
The Board believes that the education of the district's students is a shared responsibility. The Superintendent or
designee shall work with all parents/guardians, to determine appropriate roles and responsibilities of
parents/guardians, school staff and students for continuing the intellectual, physical, emotional and social
development and well-being of students at each school site, including the means by which the schools and
parents/guardians can help students achieve academic and other standards of the school.
Within this framework, the school's primary responsibility shall be to provide a high-quality curriculum and
instructional program in a supportive and effective learning environment that enables all students to meet the
academic expectations of the school.
Parents/guardians shall have the opportunity to work with schools in a mutually supportive and respectful
partnership and to help their children succeed in school. (Education Code 51100)
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that district staff understand the rights of parents/guardians afforded
by law and Board policy and follow acceptable practices that respect those rights.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that parents/guardians receive notification regarding their rights in
accordance with law.
The Superintendent or designee shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all parents/guardians who speak a
language other than English are properly notified in English, and in their home language of the rights and
opportunities available to them pursuant to Education Code 48985. (Education Code 51101.1)
