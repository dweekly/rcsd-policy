The Governing Board recognizes the need to keep district schools free of drugs and alcohol in order to
create a safe and healthy environment conducive to learning and promote student health and well-being.
The Board prohibits the possession, use, or sale of drugs and alcohol at any time in district-owned or leased
buildings, on district property, and in district vehicles, unless otherwise permitted by law. Gift giving or
fundraising events on district property may include closed and sealed alcoholic beverages not to be
consumed on campus. 
The following substances are prohibited on all district property:
1. Any substance which may not lawfully be possessed, used, or sold in California
 
2. Cannabis or cannabis products (Health and Safety Code 11362.3; 21 USC 812, 844)
 
3. Alcoholic beverages, unless approved by the Superintendent or designee for limited purposes specified
in Business and Professions Code 25608 or as noted above.
Prescription medication, except for prescribed cannabis, may be administered at school in accordance with
law, district policy and regulations, and written statements by the parent/guardian and the student's
authorized health care provider as applicable.
Information about the district's drug- and alcohol-free schools policy and the consequences for violations
shall be communicated clearly to employees, parents/guardians, students, and the community.
Enforcement/Discipline
The Superintendent or designee shall take appropriate action to eliminate the possession, use, or sale of
alcohol and other drugs and related paraphernalia in district facilities, on district property, in district vehicles,
or at school-sponsored activities. As appropriate, they may direct anyone violating this policy to leave school
property and/or refer the matter to law enforcement.
Students and employees who violate the terms of this policy may be subject to discipline and/or referred to
assistance programs in accordance with law and Board policy.
