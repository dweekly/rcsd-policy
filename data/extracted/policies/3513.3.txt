The Board of Education recognizes the health hazards associated with smoking and the use of tobacco and nicotine
products, including the breathing of second-hand smoke, constitute a serious public health hazard and are
inconsistent with district goals and desires to provide a healthy environment for students and staff.
The Board prohibits the use of tobacco products at any time in district-owned or leased buildings, on district
property and in district vehicles. (Health and Safety Code 104420; Labor Code 6404.5; 20 USC 6083)
This prohibition applies to all employees, students and visitors at any instructional program, activity or athletic event
held on or off district property. Any written joint use agreement governing community use of district facilities or
grounds shall include notice of the district's tobacco-free schools policy and consequences for violations of the
policy.
Smoking means inhaling, exhaling, burning, or carrying of any lighted or heated cigar, cigarette, pipe, tobacco, or plant
product intended for inhalation, whether natural or synthetic, in any manner or form, and includes the use of an
electronic smoking device that creates aerosol or vapor or of any oral smoking device for the purpose of
circumventing the prohibition of smoking. (Business and Professions Code 22950.5; Education Code 48901)
Tobacco products include: (Business and Professions Code 22950.5; Education Code 48901)
1. Any product containing, made, or derived from tobacco or nicotine that is intended for human consumption,
whether smoked, heated, chewed, absorbed, dissolved, inhaled, snorted, sniffed, or ingested by any other
means, including, but not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, little cigars, chewing tobacco, pipe tobacco, or snuff
 
2. An electronic device that delivers nicotine or other vaporized liquids to the person inhaling from the device,
including, but not limited to, an electronic cigarette, cigar, pipe, or hookah
 
3. Any component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product, whether or not sold separately
This policy does not prohibit the use or possession of prescription products and other cessation aids that have been
approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, such as nicotine
patch or gum.
Smoking or use of any tobacco-related product or disposal of any tobacco-related waste is prohibited within 25 feet
of any playground, except on a public sidewalk located within 25 feet of the playground. In addition, any form of
intimidation, threat, or retaliation against a person for attempting to enforce this policy is prohibited. (Health and
Safety Code 104495)
