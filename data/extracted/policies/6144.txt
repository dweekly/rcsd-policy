================================================================================

The Board of Education believes that students should have opportunities to discuss controversial issues which have
political, social or economic significance and which the students are mature enough to investigate and address. The
study of a controversial issue should help students learn how to gather and organize pertinent facts, discriminate
between fact and fiction, draw intelligent conclusions and respect the opinions of others.
The Board expects teachers to exercise caution and discretion when deciding whether or not a particular issue is
suitable for study or discussion in any particular class. Teachers should not spend class time on any topic which they
feel is not suitable for the class or related to the established course of study.
The Board also expects teachers to ensure that all sides of a controversial issue are impartially presented, with
adequate and appropriate factual information. Without promoting any partisan point of view, the teacher should
help students separate fact from opinion and warn them against drawing conclusions from insufficient data. The
teacher shall not suppress any student's view on the issue as long as its expression is not malicious or abusive toward
others.
Teachers sponsoring guest speakers shall either ask them not to use their position or influence on students to
forward their own religious, political, economic or social views or shall take active steps to neutralize whatever bias
has been presented.
