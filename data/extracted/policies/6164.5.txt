The Board of Education encourages the collaboration of parents/guardians, teachers, resource personnel,
administrators and students in evaluating the strengths and needs of students having academic, attendance or
behavioral difficulties and in identifying strategies and programs that may assist the students. The Superintendent or
designee shall establish student success teams as needed to address individual students' needs.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish a process for initiating referrals of students to the student success
team.
Each student success team shall develop intervention strategies to assist the student. Such strategies may include
changes in program placement or instructional methods, recommendation of supplemental educational services,
parent involvement strategies, behavioral interventions, discipline, referrals to other agencies or resources, and/or
other appropriate interventions.
The student success team shall monitor the student's progress, evaluate the extent to which the recommended
strategies have been implemented, and develop additional interventions as needed.
