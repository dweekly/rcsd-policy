The Board of Education recognizes that overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun and artificial sources
such as sunlamps and tanning beds is linked to the development of skin cancer, eye damage, premature aging, and a
weakened immune system and that children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of overexposure. The Board
desires to support the prevention of excessive UV radiation exposure by students and to assist students in
developing sun-safe habits to use throughout their lives.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish a developmentally appropriate prevention/intervention program for
grades K-8 to prevent student overexposure to UV radiation. He/she may coordinate sun safety and UV radiation
education and policy efforts with the California Department of Public Health, the local health department, and other
local agencies and/or community organizations. He/she shall involve students, parents/guardians, and the
community in support of such school-based programs.
The Superintendent or designee shall incorporate sun safety elements into the curriculum in order to increase
students' understanding of the health risks associated with overexposure to UV radiation from the sun or artificial
sources and to encourage students to engage in preventive practices.
Students shall be encouraged to take reasonable measures to protect their skin and eyes from overexposure to the
sun while on campus, while attending school-sponsored activities, or while under the supervision and control of
district employees.
To encourage and assist students to avoid overexposure to the sun when they are outdoors:
1. Students shall be allowed to wear sun-protective clothing, including, but not limited to, hats. (Education Code
35183.5)
 
2. Students shall be allowed to wear UV-protective sunglasses outdoors.
 
3. Students shall be allowed to use sunscreen during the school day without a physician's note or prescription.
(Education Code 35183.5)
Those students using sunscreen shall be encouraged to apply sunscreen at least 15-20 minutes prior to any
outdoor activity that will require prolonged exposure to the sun. School personnel shall not be required to
assist students in applying sunscreen.
 
4. Students shall be allowed to use UV-protective lip balm.
The Superintendent or designee shall evaluate the adequacy of shaded and/or indoor areas for recreation at each
school and shall consider the provision of sufficient shaded areas in plans for new construction or modernization of
facilities.
The Superintendent or designee may monitor the UV Index and modify outdoor school activities with regard to the
risk of harm associated with the Index level.
Staff shall be encouraged to model recommended sun-safe behaviors, such as avoiding excessive sun exposure, using
sunscreen, and wearing hats and other sun-protective clothing.
The Superintendent or designee shall inform school staff and parents/guardians of the district's sun safety measures
and shall encourage parents/guardians to provide sunscreen, lip balm, hats, and other sun-protective clothing for
their children to use at school. The Superintendent or designee also may provide information to parents/guardians
about the risks of overexposure to UV radiation and preventive measures they may take to protect their children
during nonschool hours.
