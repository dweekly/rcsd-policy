The Board of Education believes that homework should serve to enhance student learning. To that end, it is the
intent of the Board of Education to enact a policy that reflects both the findings of research and reflects the wishes
of the community of families, teachers and students.
Homework is defined as a meaningful task assigned by the teacher in class for completion by the student outside
school hours. The work shall enhance the regular instructional program done in the classroom.
The Board believes that homework includes the following:
1. Nightly Reading
The Board believes that nightly reading is important to the success of every child. Therefore, teachers should
assign reading each night during the school week. The reading may be books of the child's own choosing or
books assigned by the teacher.
In addition, the Board encourages children to read on the weekends, as well as vacation and summer time.
 
2. Other Daily Homework
The District does not require teachers to give daily homework. Daily homework, if needed and required by the
teacher, may consist of basic skills practice including such items as spelling, writing, sight words, multiplication
tables and math facts.
Long-Term Projects
Long-term projects may take the place of, or be assigned in addition to, daily homework. Teachers will receive
support in designing relevant, challenging and differentiated homework assignments that reinforce classroom
and district learning objectives.
 
3. Additional Guidelines
The Board expects staff to be knowledgeable about effective uses of homework. Teachers will receive support in
designing relevant, challenging and differentiated homework assignments that reinforce classroom and district
learning objectives.
Other than long-term projects, homework shall not be assigned on the weekends.
Timely feedback on homework allows teachers the opportunity to assess and communicate mastery of concepts to
students and parents.
No homework shall be required over breaks; students requesting optional homework shall receive it at the discretion
of the teacher.
Students will not be given detention, study hall, or otherwise be kept out of opportunities for physical activity,
including recess on a regular basis, as the result of incomplete homework assignments.
In general, students should be able to complete homework independently.
When a student sees multiple teachers during the school day, the Board expects teacher coordination with regard to
student workload.
If a parent or guardian feels that homework is not serving their child's learning or is significantly affecting family life,
the Board encourages the parent to confer with the teacher. Issues falling into this realm may include, but are not
limited to, time spent on homework and amount or type of homework. During the meeting, the teacher and parent
or guardian may determine whether adjustments are appropriate. If issues are not resolved with the teacher, the
parent is encouraged to meet with the principal.



Make up Work
Students who miss schoolwork because of an excused absence shall be given the opportunity to complete all
assignments and tests that can be reasonably provided. As determined by the teacher, the assignments and tests
shall be reasonably equivalent to, but not necessarily identical to, the assignments and tests missed during the
absence. Students shall receive full credit for work satisfactorily completed within a reasonable period of time.
With the exception of an independent study, students who miss schoolwork because of unexcused absences shall be
given the opportunity to make up missed work. Teachers shall assign such makeup work as necessary to ensure
academic progress; not as a punitive measure.
Site Procedures
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that each principal informs teachers and parents of the homework
policy and administrative regulations at least once per year at the beginning of the school year.
