================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that citizen advisory committees enable the Superintendent and the Board to
better understand the interests and concerns of the community.
The Board shall establish citizen advisory committees when required by law, to strengthen the effectiveness of
district and school operations, or to enhance student learning. The purpose of any such committees not required by
law shall be clearly defined and aligned to the district's vision, mission, and goals. The Superintendent may dissolve
any advisory committee not required by law when the committee has fulfilled its duties or at any time the Board or
Superintendent deems it necessary.
The Superintendent or designee may establish advisory committees which shall report to him/her in accordance with
law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.
Citizen advisory committees not required by law shall serve in an advisory capacity; they may make
recommendations, but their actions shall not be binding on the Board or Superintendent.
The membership of citizen advisory committees should reflect the diversity of the community and represent a
diversity of viewpoints.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide training and information, as necessary, to enable committee members
to understand the goals of the committee and to fulfill their role as committee members.
Within budget allocations, the Superintendent or designee may approve requests for committee travel and may
reimburse committee members for expenses at the same rates and under the same conditions as those provided for
district employees.
