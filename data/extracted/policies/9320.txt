state open meeting laws (Brown Act), the Governing Board shall hold its meetings in public and shall conduct closed 
sessions during such meetings only as authorized by law. To encourage community involvement in the schools, board 
meetings shall provide opportunities for comments by members of the public. All meetings shall be conducted in

upon any item within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Governing Board. (Government Code 54952.2)

kind, directly or through intermediaries, including social media and other electronic communications, to discuss, 
deliberate, or take action on any item that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Governing Board. (Government 
Code 54952.2) 
However, an employee or district official may engage in separate conversations or communications with Governing 
Board members in order to answer questions or provide information regarding an item within the subject matter 
jurisdiction of the Governing Board, as long as that employee or district official does not communicate the comments or 
position of any Governing Board members to other Governing Board members. (Government Code 54952.2)

At least 72 hours prior to a regular meeting, the agenda shall be posted at one or more locations freely accessible to 
members of the public and on the district's web site. (Government Code 54954.2)
Whenever agenda materials relating to an open session of a regular meeting are distributed to the Governing Board less
