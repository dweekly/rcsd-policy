health and the environment and shall ensure that environmental resources are used in a responsible manner.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish regulations to prevent and/or reduce environmental hazards in
accordance with law and state guidelines. Strategies shall include but not necessarily be limited to:
1. Considering air quality in the siting and architectural design of new or remodeled facilities and in the selection
of building materials and furnishings, and taking steps to reduce indoor air contaminants in maintenance
operations
 
2. Ensuring the use of effective least toxic pest management practices at all district schools
 
3. Minimizing the exposure to lead in paint, soil or drinking water, especially in areas accessible to very young
children
 
4. Inspecting and testing facilities for asbestos-containing materials and protecting persons during encapsulation
and removal of any asbestos
The Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians, as appropriate, if an environmental hazard is
discovered at a school site. The notification shall detail the district's efforts to remedy the hazard.
