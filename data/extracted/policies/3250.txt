Whenever the cost of providing student transportation exceeds funding provided by the state, the Governing Board may 
charge fees for home-to-school student transportation and other transportation services as expressly authorized by law. 
The Superintendent or designee shall annually submit proposed transportation fee schedules for Board approval. 
The transportation fee shall be waived for any student who is eligible for free or reduced-price meals, who is an 
English learner, or who is a foster youth. (Education Code 39807.5) 
At the recommendation of the Superintendent or designee, the Board may also approve a waiver of a transportation fee 
for any group of district students. 
In addition, no charge shall be made for any transportation of a student with a disability. (Education Code 39807.5). 
Students receiving free transportation shall not be identified by the use of special bus passes, tickets, lines, seats, or any 
other means. They shall in no way be treated differently from other students, nor shall their names be published, 
posted, or announced in any manner or used for any purpose other than the transportation program. 
The Board shall certify to the County Superintendent of Schools that the district has levied fees in accordance with law 
and that, in the event that excess fees have been charged, the fees have been reduced and excess fee revenue 
eliminated. (Education Code 39809.5)
