The Governing Board recognizes that the use of smartphones and other mobile communication devices on campus
may be beneficial to student learning and well-being, but could be disruptive of the instructional program in some
circumstances. The Board permits limited use of mobile communication devices on campus in accordance with law
and the following policy.
Students may use cell phones, smart watches, pagers, or other mobile communication devices on campus during
noninstructional time as long as the device is utilized in accordance with law and any rules that individual school sites
may impose.
Mobile communication devices shall be turned off during instructional time. However, a student shall not be
prohibited from possessing or using a mobile communication device under any of the following circumstances: 
(Education Code 48901.5, 48901.7)
1. In the case of an emergency, or in response to a perceived threat of danger
 
2. When a teacher or administrator grants permission to the student to possess or use a mobile communication
device, subject to any reasonable limitation imposed by that teacher or administrator
 
3. When a licensed physician or surgeon determines that the possession or use is necessary for the student's
health and well-being 
 
4. When the possession or use is required by the student's individualized education program 
Smartphones and other mobile communication devices shall not be used in any manner which infringes on the
privacy rights of any other person.
When a school official reasonably suspects that a search of a student's mobile communication device will turn up
evidence of the student's violation of the law or school rules, such a search shall be conducted in accordance with
BP/AR 5145.12 - Search and Seizure.
When a student uses a mobile communication device in an unauthorized manner, the student may be disciplined and
a district employee may confiscate the device. The employee shall store the device securely until it is returned to
the student or turned over to the principal or designee, as appropriate.
A student may also be subject to discipline, in accordance with law, Board policy, or administrative regulation, for
off-campus use of a mobile communication device which poses a threat or danger to the safety of students, staff, or
district property or substantially disrupts school activities.
The Superintendent or designee shall inform students that the district will not be responsible for a student's mobile
communication device which is brought on campus or to a school activity and is lost, stolen, or damaged.
