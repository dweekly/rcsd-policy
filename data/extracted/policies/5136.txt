================================================================================

The Board of Education desires to keep district schools free from the threats or harmful influence of any groups or
gangs which exhibit drug use, violence or disruptive behavior. The Superintendent or designee shall take steps to
deter gang intimidation of students and staff and confrontations between members of different gangs. He/she shall
exchange information and establish mutually supportive efforts with local law enforcement authorities.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide inservice training which helps staff to identify gangs and gang symbols,
recognize early manifestations of disruptive activities, and respond appropriately to gang behavior. Staff shall be
informed about conflict management techniques and alerted to intervention measures and community resources.
The Board realizes that students become involved in gangs for many reasons, such as peer pressure, the need for a
sense of belonging, and lack of refusal skills. Age-appropriate gang violence prevention education shall start with
students in the early elementary grades and may start in kindergarten.
To further discourage the influence of gangs, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that school rules of
conduct and any school dress code prohibiting gang-related apparel are enforced consistently. If a student exhibits
signs of gang affiliation, staff shall so inform the parent/guardian and at the discretion of the site administrator, the
police.
