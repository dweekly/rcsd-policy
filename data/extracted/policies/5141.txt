================================================================================

The Governing Board recognizes the importance of taking appropriate action whenever an emergency threatens the safety,
health, or welfare of a student at school or during school- sponsored activities.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop procedures to ensure that first aid and/or medical attention is provided as
quickly as possible when student accidents and injuries occur and that parents/guardians are notified as appropriate.
The Superintendent or designee shall ask parents/guardians to provide emergency contact information in order to facilitate
communication in the event of an accident or illness.
District staff shall appropriately report and document student accidents.
Do Not Resuscitate Orders
The Board believes that staff members should not be placed in the position of determining whether or not to follow any
parental or medical "do not resuscitate" orders. Staff shall not accept or follow any such orders except under the specific
written direction of the Superintendent or designee. The Superintendent or designee may only direct a staff member to
follow a "do not resuscitate" order if they have received a written parent/guardian authorization, with an authorized health
care provider statement, and an order from an appropriate court.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all parents/guardians who have submitted a "do not resuscitate" order are
informed of this policy.
Automated External Defibrillators
The Board authorizes the placement of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) at designated school sites for use by school
employees in an emergency.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop guidelines for employees regarding the use of these devices and shall ensure
that employees receive information that describes sudden cardiac arrest, the school's emergency response plan, and the
proper use of an AED. The guidelines shall also specify the placement, security, and maintenance of the AED.
The authorization of AEDs in district schools shall not be deemed to create a guarantee or obligation to use the AED in the
case of an emergency nor any expectation that an AED or trained employee will be present and/or able to use an AED in an
emergency or any expectation that the AED will operate properly.
