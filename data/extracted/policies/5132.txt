================================================================================

The Governing Board believes that appropriate dress and grooming contribute to a productive learning environment.
The Board expects students to wear clothing that is suitable for the school activities in which they participate.
Students shall not wear clothing that presents a health or safety hazard or causes a substantial disruption to the
educational program.
District and school rules pertaining to student attire shall be included in student handbooks, may be posted in school
offices and classrooms, and may be periodically reviewed with all students as necessary.
Students shall not be prohibited from dressing in a manner consistent with their gender identity or gender expression
or with their religious or cultural observance.
In addition, the dress code shall not discriminate against students based on hair texture and protective hairstyles,
including, but not limited to, braids, locks, and twists. (Education Code 212.1)
The principal or designee is authorized to enforce this policy and shall inform any student who does not reasonably
conform to the dress code. The dress code shall not be enforced in a manner that discriminates against a particular
viewpoint or results in a disproportionate application of the dress code based on students' gender, sexual orientation,
race, ethnicity, household income, or body type or size.
School administrators, teachers, and other staff shall be notified of appropriate and equitable enforcement of the
dress code.
When practical, students shall not be directed to correct a dress code violation during instructional time or in front of
other students.
Students and parents/guardians shall be informed about dress and grooming standards at the beginning of the school
year and whenever these standards are revised. Repeated violations or refusal to comply with the district's dress
code may result in disciplinary action.
The principal, staff and parents/guardians at a school may establish a reasonable dress code that prohibits students
from wearing gang-related apparel when there is evidence of a gang presence that disrupts or threatens to disrupt
the school's activities. Such a proposed dress code may be included as part of the school safety plan and must be
presented to the Board for approval. The Board shall approve the plan upon determining that it is necessary to
protect the health and safety of the school environment.
When determining specific items of clothing that may be defined as gang apparel, the school shall ensure that the
determination is free from bias based on race, ethnicity, national origin, immigration status, or other protected
characteristics.
Uniforms
The Board may approve a school-initiated dress code requiring students at the school to wear a school uniform
whenever the Board determines that such a dress code will promote student achievement, a positive school climate,
and/or student safety.
If a school's plan to require uniforms is adopted, the Superintendent or designee shall establish procedures whereby
parents/guardians may choose to have their children exempted from the school uniform policy. Students shall not be
penalized academically, otherwise discriminated against or denied attendance to school if their parents/guardians so
decide. (Education Code 35183)
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that resources are identified to assist economically disadvantaged
students in obtaining uniforms. (Education Code 35183)
