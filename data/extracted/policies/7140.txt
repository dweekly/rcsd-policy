The Governing Board desires to provide school facilities that support the educational program and meet all
applicable safety and design standards. When required by law, the Board shall employ or contract with a
licensed and certified architect and/or structural engineer to design and supervise the construction of district
schools and other facilities.
The architect and/or structural engineer shall be responsible for preparing all construction plans,
specifications, and estimates and for the observation of the work of construction. (Education Code 17302)
To ensure compliance with state design and safety standards, preliminary and final plans for any state-
funded school facility project, including Board-approved educational specifications for school design when
necessary, shall be submitted to the California Department of Education and the Department of General
Services, Division of the State Architect. (Education Code 17267; 5 CCR 14030-14032)
The Superintendent or designee shall devise a competitive process for the selection of architects, structural
engineers, and other design professionals that is based on demonstrated competence and on the
professional qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the services required. For each
project, the Superintendent or designee shall recommend architectural and engineering firms to the Board
for approval. The Board shall pay fair and reasonable amounts warranted by the provider's qualifications and
competence. The Board need not select the lowest responsible bidder.
