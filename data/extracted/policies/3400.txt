================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes its fiduciary responsibility to effectively manage and safeguard the district's
assets and resources in order to help achieve the district's goals for student learning. The Superintendent or designee
shall establish and maintain an accurate, efficient financial management system that enhances the district's ability to
meet its fiscal obligations, produces reliable financial reports, and complies with laws, regulations, policies, and
procedures. He/she shall ensure that the district's accounting system provides ongoing internal controls and meets
generally accepted accounting standards.
Capital Assets
The Superintendent or designee shall develop a system to accurately identify and value district assets in order to
help ensure financial accountability and to minimize the risk of loss or misuse. District assets with a useful life of
more than one year and an initial acquisition cost of $5,000 or more shall be considered capital assets. The
Superintendent or designee shall determine the estimated useful life of each capital asset and shall calculate and
report the estimated loss of value or depreciation during each accounting period for all capital assets.
Internal Controls/Fraud Prevention
The Board expects Board members, employees, consultants, vendors, contractors, and other parties maintaining a
business relationship with the district to act with integrity and due diligence in dealings involving the district's assets
and fiscal resources.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop internal controls which aid in the prevention and detection of fraud,
financial impropriety, or irregularity within the district. These internal controls may include, but are not limited to,
segregating employee duties relating to authorization, custody of assets, and recording or reporting of transactions;
providing detailed, written job descriptions explaining the segregation of functions; adopting an integrated financial
system; conducting background checks on business office employees; and requiring continuous in-service training for
business office staff on the importance of fraud prevention.
All employees shall be alert for any indication of fraud, financial impropriety, or irregularity within their area of
responsibility. Any employee who suspects fraud, impropriety, or irregularity shall immediately report those
suspicions to his/her immediate supervisor and/or the Superintendent or designee. In addition, the Superintendent or
designee shall establish a method for employees and outside persons to anonymously report any suspected instances
of fraud, impropriety, or irregularity.
The Superintendent or designee shall have primary responsibility for any necessary investigations of suspected fraud,
impropriety, or irregularity, in coordination with legal counsel, the district's auditors, law enforcement agencies, or
other governmental entities, as appropriate.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide regular reports to the Board on the status of the district's internal
control procedures and recommend any necessary revisions to related Board policies or administrative regulations.
