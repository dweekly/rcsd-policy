The Governing Board is committed to supporting the safety and well-being of district students and desires to facilitate the
prevention of and response to child abuse and neglect. The Superintendent or designee shall develop and implement
strategies for preventing, recognizing, and promptly reporting known or suspected child abuse and neglect.
The Superintendent or designee may provide a student who is a victim of abuse with school- based mental health services or
other support services and/or may refer the student to resources available within the community as needed.
Child Abuse Prevention
The district’s instructional program may provide age-appropriate and culturally sensitive child abuse prevention curriculum.
This curriculum shall explain students' right to live free of abuse, include instruction in the skills and techniques needed to
identify unsafe situations and react appropriately and promptly, inform them of available support resources, and teach them
how to obtain help and disclose incidents of abuse
The district's program also may include age-appropriate curriculum in sexual abuse and sexual assault awareness and
prevention. Upon written request of a student's parent/guardian, the student shall be excused from taking such instruction.
(Education Code 51900.6)
The Superintendent or designee may display posters, in areas on campus where students frequently congregate, notifying
students of the appropriate telephone number to call to report child abuse or neglect. (Education Code 33133.5)
In addition, student identification cards for students in grades 7-12 shall include the National Domestic Violence Hotline
telephone number. (Education Code 215.5)

abuse prevention programs. To the extent feasible, the Superintendent or designee shall use these community resources to
provide parents/guardians with instruction in parenting skills and child abuse prevention.
Child Abuse Reporting
The Board recognizes that child abuse has severe consequences and that the district has a legal responsibility to protect
students by facilitating the prompt reporting of known and suspected incidents of child abuse and neglect. The
Superintendent or designee shall establish procedures for the identification and reporting of such incidents in accordance
with law.
Procedures for reporting child abuse shall be included in the district and/or school comprehensive safety plan. (Education
