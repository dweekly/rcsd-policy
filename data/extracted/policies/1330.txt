================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that district facilities and grounds are a community resource and authorizes their
use by community groups for purposes provided for in the Civic Center Act when such use does not interfere with
school activities. The Board wishes to increase community access to spaces for recreation and physical activity,
before- or after-school programs or other programs that benefit students and the community. In order to ensure the
efficient use of public resources and increase access to needed services, the Governing Board may enter into an
agreement with any public agency, public institution and/or community organization to use community facilities for
school programs or to make school facilities or grounds available for use by those entities. Such an agreement shall
be based on an assessment of student and community needs and may be designed to increase access to spaces for
recreation and physical activity, library services, school health centers, preschool programs, child care centers,
before- or after-school programs or other programs that benefit students and the community. All users of school
facilities shall comply with the policies of the Board and the rules and regulations of the district.
All school-related activities shall be given priority in the use of facilities and grounds under the Civic Center Act. The
City of Redwood City's Parks and Recreation and Community Services Department shall have the next highest
priority and the Superintendent or designee shall maintain procedures and regulations for the use of school facilities
and grounds that: (Education Code 38133)
1. Aid, encourage, and assist groups desiring to use school facilities for approved activities.
 
2. Preserve order in school buildings and on school grounds and protect school facilities, designating a person to
supervise this task, if necessary.
 
3. Ensure that the use of school facilities or grounds is consistent with their use for school purposes and does not
interfere with the regular conduct of school work.
Fees
In accordance with Education Code 38134(a), the Board authorizes the use of school facilities or grounds without
charge by nonprofit organizations, clubs or associations organized to promote youth and school activities.
Groups shall be charged fair rental value when using school facilities or grounds for entertainment or meetings where
admission is charged or contributions solicited and net receipts are not to be expended for charitable purposes or for
the welfare of the district's students. (Education Code 38134)
