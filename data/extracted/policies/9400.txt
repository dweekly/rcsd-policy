================================================================================

The Board of Education shall annually conduct a self-evaluation in order to demonstrate accountability to the
community and ensure that district governance effectively supports student achievement and the attainment of the
district's vision and goals.
The evaluation may address any areas of Board responsibility, including but not limited to Board performance in
relation to vision setting, curriculum, personnel, finance, policy, collective bargaining and community relations. The
evaluation also may address objectives related to Board meeting operations, relationships among Board members,
relationship with the Superintendent, understanding of Board and Superintendent roles and responsibilities,
communication skills, or other boardsmanship skills.
The Board shall be evaluated as a whole. Individual Board members also are encouraged to use the evaluation
process as an opportunity to privately assess their own personal performance.
Each year the Board, with assistance from the Superintendent, shall determine an evaluation method or instrument
that measures a reasonable number of previously identified performance objectives. Videotape of a Board meeting
may be used as an evaluation tool only with the consent of all Board members.
Any discussion of the Board's self-evaluation shall be conducted in open session. At the request of the Board, a
facilitator may be used to assist with the evaluation process. The Board may invite the Superintendent or others to
provide input into the evaluation process.
Following the evaluation, the Board shall develop strategies for strengthening Board performance and shall establish
priorities and objectives for the following year's evaluation.
