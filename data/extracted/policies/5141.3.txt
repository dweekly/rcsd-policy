The Board of Education recognizes that periodic physical and oral health examinations of students may lead to the
detection and treatment of conditions. Health examinations also may help in determining whether special
adaptations of the school program are necessary.
In addition to verifying that students have complied with legal requirements for health examinations and
immunizations before enrolling in school, the district shall administer tests for vision, hearing and scoliosis as required
by law.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that staff employed to examine students exercise proper care of each
student and that examination results are kept confidential. Records related to these examinations shall be available
only in accordance with law.
Reports to the Board regarding the number of students found to have physical problems and the effort made to
correct them shall in no way reveal the identity of students.
