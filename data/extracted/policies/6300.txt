================================================================================

The Board of Education recognizes that high-quality preschool experiences for children ages 3-5 help them develop
knowledge, skills, and attributes necessary to be successful in school and provide for a smooth transition into the
elementary education program. Such programs should provide developmentally appropriate activities in a safe, well-
supervised, cognitively rich environment.
District Preschool Programs
The Board shall set priorities for establishing or expanding currently offered services as resources become available.
In so doing, the Board shall give consideration to the benefits of providing early education programs for at-risk
children and/or children residing in the attendance areas of the lowest performing district schools.
Facilities for preschool classrooms shall be addressed in the district's comprehensive facilities plan, including an
assessment as to whether adequate and appropriate space exists on school sites. As necessary, the Superintendent
or designee shall provide information to the Board regarding facilities financing options for preschool classrooms
and/or facilities available through partnering organizations.
To enable children of working parents/guardians to participate in the district's preschool program, the
Superintendent or designee shall recommend strategies to provide a full-day program and/or to link to other full-day
child care programs in the district or community to the extent possible.
Inasmuch as parents/guardians are essential partners in supporting the development of their children, the
Superintendent or designee shall involve them in program planning. Program staff shall encourage volunteerism in
the program and shall communicate frequently with parents/guardians of enrolled students regarding their child's
progress.
The district's preschool program shall contribute to the development of language, cognitive, social, emotional, and
physical skills.
The district's preschool program shall provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services and support the needs
of English learners. The program also shall provide appropriate services for students with disabilities, including but
not limited to early screening to identify special needs among preschool students and intervention services to assist
students identified with special needs in accordance with law.
To maximize the ability of children to succeed in the preschool program, program staff shall support students' health
through proper nutrition and physical activity and shall provide or make referrals to health and social services.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that administrators, teachers, and paraprofessionals in district preschool
programs possess the appropriate credential(s) or permit(s) issued by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing and
meet any additional qualifications established by the Board.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop and implement an annual plan of evaluation which conforms to state
requirements. (5 CCR 18279)
He/she shall regularly report to the Board regarding enrollments in district preschool programs and the effectiveness
of the programs in preparing preschool students for transition into the elementary education program.

for the Governing Board to enact this policy. Instead, they are provided as additional resources for those interested in the subject matter
