The Board of Education recognizes its responsibility to inform parents/guardians and the community about the
conditions, needs, and progress at each district school and to provide data by which parents/guardians can make
meaningful comparisons between schools. The process of gathering and analyzing data also provides opportunities
for school and district staff to review achievements and identify areas for improvement.
The Board shall annually issue a school accountability report card (SARC) for each school site. (Education Code
35256)
In preparing the district's report cards, the Superintendent or designee may choose to use or adapt the model
template provided by the California Department of Education. If the model template is not used, the Superintendent
or designee shall ensure that data are reported in a manner that is consistent with the definitions for school
conditions as provided in the template. At least every three years, the Board shall compare the content of the
district's report cards to the state's model template, recognizing that variances are allowed by law as necessary to
meet local needs. (Education Code 33126.1, 35256)
The Board shall annually approve the SARCs for all district schools and shall evaluate the data contained in the
SARCs as part of the Board's regular review of the effectiveness of the district's programs, personnel, and fiscal
operations.
The Superintendent or designee shall develop strategies for communicating the information contained in the SARCs
to all stakeholders, including opportunities for staff and the community to discuss their content.
Notification and Dissemination of SARCs
The Superintendent or designee shall annually publicize the issuance of the SARCs and notify parents/guardians that
a paper copy will be provided upon request. On or before February 1 of each year, the Superintendent or designee
shall make the SARCs available in paper copy and on the Internet. (Education Code 35256)
