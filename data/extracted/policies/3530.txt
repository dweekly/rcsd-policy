================================================================================

The Governing Board strongly supports a risk management program that protects district resources and promotes
the safety of students, staff and the public. The Superintendent or designee shall establish a risk management
program that uses effective safety and loss control practices. 
The district shall strive to keep its liability at a minimum and its insurance premiums as low as possible while
maintaining adequate protection against loss which may occur due to hazards facing the district.
To determine the most economical means of insuring the district consistent with required services, the
Superintendent or designee shall annually review the district's options for obtaining coverage, including qualified
insurance agents, a joint powers agency, self-insurance or a combination of these means. Decisions regarding the
means of insuring the district shall be based on a careful analysis of past claims records indicating the frequency and
magnitude of losses and a prediction of future losses.
To minimize the district's exposure to liability, the Board shall adopt clear policies related to discrimination,
harassment, safety procedures, and the timely handling of claims. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that
these policies and related procedures are enforced fairly and consistently. The Superintendent or designee shall
provide safety-related training and protective equipment to staff as appropriate for their position.
The Superintendent or designee shall periodically report to the Board on the district's risk management activities,
including, but not limited to, the district's property and liability risks and exposures and the effectiveness of the
district's risk management and loss control practices.
