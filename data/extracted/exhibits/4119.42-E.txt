Hepatitis B Vaccine Declination
I understand that due to my occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials I
may be at risk of acquiring hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. I have been given the opportunity to be
vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine, at no charge to myself. However, I decline hepatitis B vaccination
at this time. I understand that by declining this vaccine, I continue to be at risk of acquiring hepatitis B,
a serious disease. If in the future I continue to have occupational exposure to blood or other potentially
infectious materials and I want to be vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine, I can receive the vaccination
series at no charge to myself.
