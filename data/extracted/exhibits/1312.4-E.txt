Exhibit 1
NOTICE TO PARENTS/GUARDIANS, PUPILS, AND TEACHERS:
COMPLAINT RIGHTS
Parents/Guardians, Pupils, and Teachers:
Pursuant to Education Code 35186, you are hereby notified that:
1. There should be sufficient textbooks and instructional materials. For there to be sufficient textbooks
and instructional materials, each pupil, including English learners, must have a textbook or
instructional material, or both, to use in class and to take home.
2. School facilities must be clean, safe, and maintained in good repair.
3. There should be no teacher vacancies or misassignments. There should be a teacher assigned to each
class and not a series of substitutes or other temporary teachers. The teacher should have the proper
credential to teach the class, including the certification required to teach English learners, if present.
Teacher vacancy means a position to which a single designated certificated employee has not been
assigned at the beginning of the year for an entire year or, if the position is for a one-semester course, a
position to which a single designated certificated employee has not been assigned at the beginning of a
semester for an entire semester.
Misassignment means the placement of a certificated employee in a teaching or services position for
which the employee does not hold a legally recognized certificate or credential or the placement of a
certificated employee in a teaching or services position that the employee is not otherwise authorized
by statute to hold.
4. Pupils, including English learners, who have not passed one or both parts of the high school exit
examination by the end of grade 12 are to be provided the opportunity to receive intensive instruction
and services for up to two consecutive academic years after the completion of grade 12.
5. A complaint form can be obtained at the school office or district office, or downloaded from the
school or district web site. You may also download a copy of the California Department of Education
complaint form from the following web site: http://www.cde.ca.gov/re/cp/uc.
