Because school bus passengers' behavior can directly affect their safety and the safety of others, the following
regulations apply at all times when students are riding a school bus, including school activity trips.
1. Riders shall follow the instructions and directions of the bus driver at all times.
 
2. Riders should arrive at the bus stop on time and stand in a safe place to wait quietly for the bus.
 
3. Riders shall enter the bus in an orderly manner and go directly to their seats.
 
4. Riders shall remain seated while the bus is in motion and shall not obstruct the aisle with their legs, feet, or
other objects. When reaching their destination, riders shall remain seated until the bus stops and only then
enter the aisle and go directly to the exit.
 
5. Riders should be courteous to the driver and to fellow passengers.
 
6. Because serious safety hazards can result from noise or behavior that distracts the driver, loud talking,
laughing, yelling, singing, whistling, scuffling, throwing objects, smoking, eating, drinking, standing and changing
seats are prohibited actions which may lead to suspension of riding privileges.
 
7. No part of the body, hands, arms or head should be put out of the window. Nothing should be thrown from the
bus.
 
8. Riders shall help keep the bus and the area around the bus stop clean. Riders shall not damage or deface the
bus or tamper with bus equipment.
 
9. No animals shall be allowed on the bus without express permission from the principal or designee except for
service animals.
 
10. Riders should be alert for traffic when leaving the bus.
Riders who fail to comply with the above rules shall be reported to the school principal, who shall determine the
severity of the misconduct and take action accordingly. In all instances of misconduct, the rider and his/her
parent/guardian shall be given notice and warning. In the case of a severe violation or repeated offenses, the rider
may be denied transportation for a period of time determined by the principal, up to the remainder of the school
year.
Bus drivers shall not deny transportation except as directed by the principal.
Video Camera Surveillance
The Superintendent or designee shall supervise the use and maintenance of video cameras.
Students and staff shall not tamper or interfere with video camera equipment on school buses.
Camera supports shall be installed in all buses, and cameras shall be rotated among the buses and activated at the
discretion of the Superintendent or designee.
The Superintendent or designee shall notify students, parents/guardians and staff that video surveillance may occur
on any school bus and that video recordings may be used in student disciplinary proceedings. This notification shall
include a copy of the district's policy and regulation on bus conduct. In addition, a prominent notice shall be placed in
each bus, stating that the bus is equipped with a video monitoring system.
The Superintendent or designee shall routinely review videotapes taken on school buses and shall document any
evidence of student misconduct. Two weeks after this review, the Superintendent or designee may erase any tapes
that do not show incidents of misconduct.
Tapes retained as part of an individual student's disciplinary record shall be maintained in accordance with law and
Board policy governing the access, review and release of student records. Tapes retained as part of an expulsion



record are nonprivileged, disclosable public records pursuant to Education Code 48918.
Videotapes may be viewed by persons other than the Superintendent or designee under the following conditions:
1. When student misconduct is revealed as a result of a school bus videotape or reported to the Superintendent
or designee by a student, staff member or parent/guardian, students involved in the incident and their
parents/guardians may ask the Superintendent or designee for an opportunity to view the videotape.
 
a. Requests for viewing must be made within five school days of receiving notification that misconduct
occurred.
 
b. A viewing shall be provided or denied within five days of the request.
 
c. Viewing will be limited to those frames containing the incident of misconduct.
 
2. Bus drivers and school administrators may ask to view a videotape in order to observe a specific problem and
work toward its solution.
 
3. Viewing shall occur only at a school-related site and in the presence of the Superintendent or designee.
 
4. All persons who view a tape shall be identified in a written log.
