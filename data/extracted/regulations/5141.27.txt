Definitions
Special dietary needs include food intolerances, allergies, and other medical needs that may require avoidance of
specific foods.
Food allergies are abnormal responses of the body's immune system to certain foods or ingredients.
Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity to a substance and may be caused by a food allergy.
Symptoms may include shortness of breath, wheezing, difficulty breathing, difficulty talking or swallowing, hives,
itching, swelling, shock, or asthma. (Education Code 49414)
In severe cases, anaphylaxis may result in lowered blood pressure, loss of consciousness, or even death. Symptoms
typically appear immediately after exposure to a certain food or substance but in rare cases may occur after a few
hours.
Epinephrine auto-injector is a disposable drug delivery system with a spring-activated concealed needle that is
designed for emergency administration of epinephrine to persons suffering a potentially fatal reaction to anaphylaxis.
(Education Code 49414)
Notification by Parent/Guardian
If their child has a known food allergy, the parents/guardians shall notify the Superintendent or designee, in writing,
and provide written medical documentation, signed by a physician, that describes the nature of the student's
condition, instructions, and necessary medications. If the food allergy requires food substitutions or modifications in
school meals, the written statement shall also describe the specific foods to be restricted and the foods that should
be substituted.
Prevention
To minimize students' exposure to foods to which they are allergic, the Superintendent or designee shall, at a
minimum, implement the following preventive measures:
1. Notification to District Staff
When notified by the parent/guardian that a student has a food allergy, the Superintendent or designee shall
inform the student's principal, teacher(s), bus driver, school nurse, coach, substitute teacher, and/or any other
personnel responsible for supervising the student.
The principal or designee shall notify substitute staff of any students with known food allergies and the
school's response plan.
 
2. Food Services
The district's food services program shall make food substitutions in breakfasts, lunches, and after-school
snacks when students are considered to have a disability under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of
1973 that restricts their diet and when a physician has signed a statement of need that includes recommended
alternate foods. (7 CFR 210.10, 220.8)
Substitutions may be made on a case-by-case basis for students who do not have a disability under Section
504 but who cannot consume the regular breakfast, lunch, or after-school snack because of medical or other
special dietary needs, when supported by a statement of need signed by a recognized medical authority. (7
CFR 210.10, 220.8, 225.16)
The district's food services staff shall check food labels or specifications to ensure that foods do not contain
traces of substances to which the student is allergic.
Under no circumstances shall food services staff prescribe nutritional requirements or revise a diet order
prescribed by a physician.
Board Policy Manual
Redwood City School District

Policy Reference Disclaimer:
Food substitutions shall not result in any additional cost to the student.
 
3. Class Parties/School Activities
Without identifying the student, the principal or teacher may notify parents/guardians of other students in the
class that a student is allergic to a specific food and may request that the food not be provided at class parties
or other school events.
Whenever the ingredients in any food served at class parties or other school activities are unknown, the
student shall be encouraged to avoid the food.
 
4. Sanitation and Cleaning
To avoid spreading allergens, cafeteria tables and classroom surfaces shall be cleaned with a fresh cloth or
disposable paper towels and cleaning products known to effectively remove food proteins, excluding waterless
cleaners or instant hand sanitizers that do not involve a wet-wash step. Cross-contact from a sponge or cloth
used to clean allergen-containing tabletops shall be avoided.
Staff shall use and promote hand-washing using soap and water before and after food handling.
Students shall be notified that exchanging meals or utensils is prohibited.
 
5. Professional Development
Schoolwide professional development shall be provided to appropriate staff on the identification and
management of food allergies, including avoidance measures, typical symptoms, the proper use of epinephrine
auto-injectors, documentation and storage of medication, and emergency drills.
 
6. Supervision of Students
Staff who are trained and knowledgeable about symptoms of anaphylaxis and actions to take in an emergency
shall provide supervision in the classroom and cafeteria and on the playground whenever students known to
have a food allergy are on school grounds.
 
7. Health Education
The district's health education curriculum may include instruction on food allergies in order to assist food-allergic
students in taking responsibility for monitoring their diet and to teach other students about the dangers of sharing
foods or utensils with others.
Emergency Response
Epinephrine auto-injectors or other medicine provided for use in the event of an anaphylactic shock reaction shall be
stored and used in accordance with law and BP/AR 5141.21 - Administering Medication and Monitoring Health
Conditions.
In addition, staff shall call 911 and seek immediate medical attention for a student experiencing an anaphylactic
shock reaction.
As soon as possible, school staff shall contact the student's parents/guardians or other person identified as an
emergency contact.
