The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that appropriate computer software is used to safeguard any data
stored on computers, including computers connected to networks. To further prevent the damage or theft of data,
computers and related equipment, he/she shall maintain complete and accurate inventories, specify user
responsibilities for damages, and provide appropriate supervision in areas where computers are used.
Classification of Records
Before January 1, the Superintendent or designee shall review documents and papers originating during the prior
school year and classify them as Class 1 (Permanent), Class 2 (Optional), or Class 3 (Disposable). Records of
continuing nature (active and useful for administrative, legal, fiscal or other purposes over a period of years) shall not
be classified until such usefulness has ceased. A student's cumulative record is a continuing record until the student
ceases to be enrolled in the district. (5 CCR 16022)
Class 1 - Permanent Record (5 CCR 16023)
The original of each of the following records, or one exact copy of it when the original is required by law to be filed
with another agency, is a Class 1 (Permanent) Record and shall be retained indefinitely unless microfilmed in
accordance with 5 CCR 16022:
1. Annual Reports
 
a. Official budget
 
b. Financial reports of all funds, including cafeteria and student body funds
 
c. Audit of all funds
 
d. Average daily attendance, including Period 1 and Period 2 reports
 
e. Other major annual reports, including:
 
i. Those containing information relating to property, activities, financial condition or transactions
 
ii. Those declared by Board of Education minutes to be permanent

a. Minutes of the Board or Board committees, including the text of rules, regulations, policies or resolutions
included by reference only
 
b. The call for and the result of any elections called, conducted or canvassed by the Board
 
c. Records transmitted by another agency pertaining to its action with respect to district reorganization

All detailed records relating to employment, assignment, amounts and dates of service rendered,
termination or dismissal of an employee in any position, sick leave record, rate of compensation, salaries
or wages paid, deductions or withholdings made and the person or agency to whom such amounts were
paid. In lieu of the detailed records, a complete proven summary payroll record for each employee
containing the same data may be classified as Class 1 (Permanent), and the detailed records may then be
classified as Class 3 (Disposable).

b. Students
The records of enrollment and scholarship for each student required by 5 CCR 432, and all records
pertaining to any accident or injury involving a minor for which a claim for damages had been filed as
required by law. This includes any related policy of liability insurance except that these records cease to
be Class 1 (Permanent) one year after the claim has been settled or the statute of limitations has run.
 
4. Property Records
All detailed records relating to land, buildings, and equipment. In lieu of detailed records, a complete property ledger
may be classified as Class 1 (Permanent). The detailed records may then be classified as Class 3 (Disposable) if the
property ledger includes all fixed assets, an equipment inventory and, for each piece of property, the date of
acquisition, name of previous owner, a legal description, the amount paid, and comparable data if the unit is disposed
of.
Class 2 - Optional Records (5 CCR 16024)
Any record considered worth keeping, but which is not a Class 1 record, may be classified as Class 2 (Optional) and
shall be retained until it is reclassified as Class 3 (Disposable). If by agreement of the Board and Superintendent or
designee, classification of the prior year records has not been made before January 1, all records of the prior year
may be classified Class 2 (Optional) until they are classified as required by 5 CCR 16022. Such classification must
occur within one year.
Class 3 - Disposable Records (5 CCR 16025, 16026, 16027)
All records not classified as Class 1 (Permanent) or as Class 2 (Optional) shall be classified as Class 3 (Disposable).
These include but are not limited to: detailed records basic to audit, including those relating to attendance, average
daily attendance, or business or financial transactions; detailed records used in preparing another report; teachers'
registers if all information required by 5 CCR 432 is retained in other records or if the General Records pages are
removed from the register and classified as Class 1 (Permanent); and periodic reports, including daily, weekly and
monthly reports, bulletins and instructions.
Class 3 (Disposable) records shall be destroyed during the third school year after the later of the following:
1. The completion of any legally required audit
 
2. The retention period required by any agency other than the State of California
 
3. The school year in which the records originated
The Board of Education authorizes the use of consultants to provide expert professional advice or specialized
technical or training services which are not needed on a continuing basis and which cannot be provided by district
staff because of limitations of time, experience or knowledge. Individuals, firms or organizations employed as
consultants may assist management with decisions and/or project development related to financial, economic,
accounting, engineering, legal, administrative, instructional or other matters.
As part of the contract process, the Superintendent or designee shall determine, in accordance with Internal Revenue
Service guidelines, that the consultant is properly classified as an independent contractor. District employees who
perform extra-duty consultant services shall not be retained as independent contractors. They shall be considered
employees for all purposes, even if the additional services are not related to their regular duties.
All consultant contracts shall be brought to the Board for approval.
The district shall not contract for consulting services that can be performed without charge by a public agency or
official unless these services are unavailable from the public source for reasons beyond the district's control.
All qualified firms or resource persons shall be accorded equal opportunity for consultant contracts regardless of
race, creed, color, gender, national or ethnic origin, age or disability.
Independent contractors applying for a consultant contract shall submit a written conflict of interest statement
disclosing financial interests as determined necessary by the Superintendent or designee, depending on the range of
duties to be performed by the consultant. The Superintendent or designee shall consider this statement when
deciding whether to recommend the consultant's employment.

Policy Reference Disclaimer:
When employees of a public university, county office of education or other public agency serve as consultant or
resource persons for the district, they shall certify as part of the consultant agreement that they will not receive
salary or remuneration other than vacation pay from any other public agency for the specific days when they work
for this district.
