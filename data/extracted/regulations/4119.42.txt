Definitions
Occupational exposure means reasonably anticipated skin, eye, mucous membrane, or parenteral contact with blood
or other potentially infectious materials that may result from the performance of an employee's duties. (8 CCR
5193(b))
Exposure incident means a specific eye, mouth, other mucous membrane, nonintact skin, or parenteral contact with
blood or other potentially infectious materials that result from the performance of an employee's duties. (8 CCR
5193 (b))
Parenteral contact means piercing mucous membranes or the skin barrier through such events as needlesticks, human
bites, cuts, and abrasions. (8 CCR 5193(b))
A sharp is any object that can be reasonably anticipated to penetrate the skin or any other part of the body and to
result in an exposure incident. (8 CCR 5193(b))
A sharps injury is any injury caused by a sharp, including but not limited to cuts, abrasions or needlesticks. (8 CCR
5193(b))
Work practice controls are controls that reduce the likelihood of exposure by defining the manner in which a task is
performed. (8 CCR 5193(b))
Engineering controls are controls, such as sharps disposal containers, needleless systems, and sharps with engineered
sharps injury protection, that isolate or remove the bloodborne pathogens hazard from the workplace. (8 CCR
5193(b))
Engineered sharps injury protection is a physical attribute built into a needle device or into a non-needle sharp which
effectively reduces the risk of an exposure incident. (8 CCR 5193(b))
Exposure Control Plan
The district's exposure control plan shall contain at least the following components: (8 CCR 5193(c))
1. A determination of which employees have occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious
materials
The district's exposure determination shall be made without regard to the use of personal protective
equipment and shall include a list of:
 
a. All job classifications in which all employees have occupational exposure
 
b. Job classifications in which some employees have occupational exposure
 
c. All tasks and procedures, or groups of closely related tasks and procedures, in which occupational
exposure occurs and which are performed by employees listed in item #b above
 
2. The schedule and method of implementing:
 
a. Methods of compliance required by 8 CCR 5193(d), such as universal precautions, general and specific
engineering and work practice controls, and personal protective equipment
 
b. Hepatitis B vaccination
 
c. Bloodborne pathogen post-exposure evaluation and follow-up
 
d. Communication of hazards to employees, including labels, signs, information and training
 
e. Recordkeeping
 


3. The district's procedure for evaluating circumstances surrounding exposure incidents
 
4. An effective procedure for gathering information about each exposure incident involving a sharp, as required
for the log of sharps injuries
 
5. An effective procedure for periodically determining the frequency of use of the types and brands of sharps
involved in exposure incidents documented in the sharps injury log
 
6. An effective procedure for identifying currently available engineering controls and selecting such controls as
appropriate for the procedures performed by employees in their work areas or departments
 
7. An effective procedure for documenting instances when a licensed healthcare professional directly involved in
a patient's care determines, in the reasonable exercise of clinical judgment, that the use of an engineering
control would jeopardize an individual's safety or the success of a medical, dental or nursing procedure
involving the individual
 
8. An effective procedure for obtaining the active involvement of employees in reviewing and updating the
exposure control plan with respect to the procedures performed by employees in their respective work areas
or departments
The exposure control plan shall be reviewed and updated at least annually and whenever necessary to: (8 CCR
5193(c))
1. Reflect new or modified tasks and procedures affecting occupational exposure
 
2. To the extent that sharps are used in the district, reflect progress in implementing the use of needleless
systems and sharps with engineered sharps injury protection
 
3. Include new or revised employee positions with occupational exposure
 
4. Review and evaluate the exposure incidents which occurred since the previous update
 
5. Review and respond to information indicating that the exposure control plan is deficient in any area
The district's exposure control plan shall be accessible to employees upon request. (8 CCR 3204(e))
Preventive Measures
The Superintendent or designee shall use engineering and work practice controls to eliminate or minimize employee
exposure, and shall regularly examine and update controls to ensure their effectiveness. (8 CCR 5193(d))
Hepatitis B Vaccination
The hepatitis B vaccination and vaccination series shall be made available at no cost to all employees who have
occupational exposure. The hepatitis B vaccination shall be made available after an employee with occupational
exposure has received the required training and within 10 working days of initial assignment, unless the employee
has previously received the complete hepatitis B vaccination series, or antibody testing has revealed that the
employee is immune, or vaccination is contraindicated by medical reasons. (8 CCR 5193(f))
Employees who decline to accept the vaccination shall sign the hepatitis B declination statement. (8 CCR 5193(f))
The Superintendent or designee may exempt designated first aid providers from the pre-exposure hepatitis B
vaccine in accordance with 8 CCR 5193 (f).
Information and Training
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all employees with occupational exposure participate in a training
program containing the elements required by state regulations, during working hours and at no cost to the employee.
This program shall be offered at the time of initial assignment to tasks where occupational exposure may take place,
at least annually thereafter, and whenever a change of tasks or procedures affects the employee's exposure. (8 CCR
5193(g))
Designated first aid providers shall receive training that includes the specifics of reporting first-aid incidents which

involve blood or body fluids which are potentially infectious. (8 CCR 5193(g))
Reporting Incidents
All exposure incidents shall be reported as soon as possible to the Superintendent or designee.
Unvaccinated designated first aid providers must report any first aid incident involving the presence of blood or
other potentially infectious material, regardless of whether an exposure incident occurred, by the end of the work
shift. The full hepatitis B vaccination series shall be made available to such employees no later than 24 hours after
the first aid incident. (8 CCR 5193(f))
Sharps Injury Log
The Superintendent or designee shall establish and maintain a log recording each exposure incident involving a sharp.
The exposure incident shall be recorded within 14 working days of the date the incident is reported to the district. (8
CCR 5193(c))
The information recorded shall include the following, if known or reasonably available: (8 CCR 5193(c))
1. Date and time of the exposure incident
 
2. Type and brand of sharp involved in the exposure incident
 
3. A description of the exposure incident, including:
 
a. Job classification of the exposed employee
 
b. Department or work area where the exposure incident occurred
 
c. The procedure that the exposed employee was performing at the time of the incident
 
d. How the incident occurred
 
e. The body part involved in the incident
 
f. If the sharp had engineered sharps injury protection, whether the protective mechanism was activated
and whether the injury occurred before, during or after the protective mechanism was activated
 
g. If the sharp had no engineered sharps injury protection, the injured employee's opinion as to whether
and how such a mechanism could have prevented the injury
 
h. The employee's opinion about whether any other engineering, administrative or work practice could
have prevented the injury
Post-Exposure Evaluation and Follow-up
Following a report of an exposure incident, the Superintendent or designee shall immediately make available to the
exposed employee, at no cost, a confidential medical evaluation, post-exposure evaluation and follow-up. The
Superintendent or designee shall, at a minimum: (8 CCR 5193(f))
1. Document the route(s) of exposure and the circumstances under which the exposure incident occurred
 
2. Identify and document the source individual, unless that identification is infeasible or prohibited by law
 
3. Provide for the collection and testing of the employee's blood for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV serological
status
 
4. Provide for post-exposure prophylaxis, when medically indicated, as recommended by the U.S. Public Health
Service
 
5. Provide for counseling and evaluation of reported illnesses
The Superintendent or designee shall provide the health care professional with a copy of 8 CCR 5193; a description


of the employee's duties as they relate to the exposure incident; documentation of the route(s) of exposure and
circumstances under which exposure occurred; results of the source individual's blood testing, if available; and all
medical records maintained by the district relevant to the appropriate treatment of the employee, including
vaccination status. (8 CCR 5193(f))
The district shall maintain the confidentiality of the affected employee and the exposure source during all phases of
the post-exposure evaluation. (8 CCR 5193(f))
Records
Upon an employee's initial employment and at least annually thereafter, the Superintendent or designee shall inform
employees with occupational exposure of the existence, location and availability of related records; the person
responsible for maintaining and providing access to records; and the employee's right of access to these records. (8
CCR 3204)
Medical records for each employee with occupational exposure shall be kept confidential and not disclosed or
reported without the employee's written consent to any person within or outside the workplace except as required
by law. (8 CCR 5193(h))
Upon request by an employee, or a designated representative with the employee's written consent, the
Superintendent or designee shall provide access to a record in a reasonable time, place and manner, no later than 15
days after the request is made. (8 CCR 3204(e))
Records shall be maintained as follows: (8 CCR 3204(d), 5193(h))
1. Medical records shall be maintained for the duration of employment plus 30 years.
 
2. Training records shall be maintained for three years from the date of training.
