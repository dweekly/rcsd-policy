================================================================================

In cooperation with teachers, students and parents/guardians, the principal or designee shall establish school rules
governing student dress and grooming which are consistent with law, board policy and administrative regulations.
These school dress codes shall be regularly reviewed.
The following guidelines shall apply to all regular school activities:
1. Clothing, jewelry and personal items (backpacks, fanny packs, gym bags, water bottles etc.) shall be free of
writing, pictures or any other insignia which are crude, lewd, obscene, profane or sexually suggestive, or which
promote the use of drugs, alcohol, tobacco, or which advocate racial, ethnic or religious prejudice, or any other
illegal activity.
2. Appropriate shoes must be worn at all times.
3. Hats, caps and other head coverings shall not be worn indoors.
4. Clothes shall be sufficient to conceal undergarments at all times. See-through or fish- net fabrics, halter tops,
off-the-shoulder or low-cut tops, bare midriffs and skirts or shorts shorter than mid-thigh are prohibited.
The dress code shall be modified as appropriate to accommodate a student's religious or cultural observance, health
condition, or other circumstance deemed necessary by the principal or designee. In addition, the principal or
designee may impose dress requirements to accommodate the needs of special school activities, physical education
classes, athletic activities, and other extracurricular and cocurricular activities.
No grade of a student participating in a physical education class shall be adversely affected if the student does not
wear standardized physical education apparel because of circumstances beyond the student's control. (Education
Code 49066)
Each school shall allow students to wear sun-protective clothing, including but not limited to hats, for outdoor use
during the school day. (Education Code 35183.5)
At individual schools that have a dress code prohibiting gang-related apparel at school or school activities, the
principal, staff and parents/guardians participating in the development of the school safety plan shall define "gang-
related apparel" and shall limit this definition to apparel that reasonably could be determined to threaten the health
and safety of the school environment if it were worn or displayed on a school campus. (Education Code 32282)
Because gang-related symbols are constantly changing, definitions of gang-related apparel shall be reviewed at least
once each semester and updated whenever related information is received. As necessary, the school shall collaborate
with law enforcement agencies to update definitions of gang-related apparel.
Uniforms
In schools where a schoolwide uniform is required, the principal, staff and parents/guardians of the individual school
shall jointly select the specific uniform to be worn. (Education Code 35183)
At least six months before a school uniform policy is implemented, the principal or designee shall notify
parents/guardians of this policy. (Education Code 35183)
Parents/guardians shall also be informed of their right to have their child exempted.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish criteria for determining student eligibility for financial assistance
when purchasing uniforms.
Students who participate in a nationally recognized youth organization shall be allowed to wear organization
uniforms on days when the organization has a scheduled meeting. (Education Code 35183)
