plan. A copy of the rules shall be filed with the Superintendent or designee for inclusion in the comprehensive safety
plan.

Disciplinary Strategies
To the extent possible, staff shall use disciplinary strategies that keep students in school and participating in the
instructional program. Except when a student's presence causes a danger to themself or others or they commit a
single act of a grave nature or an offense for which suspension or expulsion is required by law, suspension or
expulsion shall be used only when other means of correction have failed to bring about proper conduct.
Disciplinary strategies include but are not limited to:

2. Referral of the student to the school counselor or other school support service personnel for case
management and counseling

behavior and develop and implement an individual plan to address the behavior in partnership with the student

purposes of creating an individualized education program or a Section 504 plan

student's records. (Education Code 48900.5)
Corporal Punishment
Corporal punishment shall not be used as a disciplinary measure against any student. Corporal punishment includes
the willful infliction of, or willfully causing the infliction of, physical pain on a student. (Education Code 49001)
For purposes of this policy, corporal punishment does not include an employee's use of force that is reasonable and
necessary to protect the employee, students, staff or other persons or to prevent damage to property or to obtain
possession of weapons or other dangerous objects within the control of the student. (Education Code 49001)
Recess Restriction
A teacher may restrict a student's recess time when they believe that this action is the most effective way to bring
about improved behavior. When recess restriction may involve the withholding of physical activity from a student,
the teacher shall try other disciplinary measures before imposing the restriction. Recess restriction shall be subject to
the following conditions:
1. The student shall be given adequate time to use the restroom and get a drink or eat lunch, as appropriate.
 
2. The student shall remain under a certificated employee's supervision during the period of restriction.
 
3. Teachers shall inform the principal of any recess restrictions they impose.
Detention After School
Students may be detained for disciplinary reasons up to one hour after the close of the maximum school day. (5 CCR
353)
If a student will miss his/her school bus on account of being detained after school, or if the student is not transported
by school bus, the principal or designee shall notify parents/guardians of the detention at least one day in advance so
that alternative transportation arrangements may be made. The student shall not be detained unless the principal or
designee notifies the parent/guardian.
In cases where the school bus departs more than one hour after the end of the school day, students may be detained
until the bus departs. (5 CCR 307, 353)
Students shall remain under the supervision of a certificated employee during the period of detention.

Policy Reference Disclaimer:
Students may be offered the choice of serving their detention on Saturday rather than after school.
Community Service
As part of or instead of disciplinary action, the Board, Superintendent, principal or principal's designee may, at their
discretion, require a student to perform community service on school grounds, or with written permission of the
student's parent/guardian off school grounds, during nonschool hours. Such service may include, but is not limited to,
community or school outdoor beautification, campus betterment, and teacher, peer or youth assistance programs.
(Education Code 48900.6)
This community service option is not available for a student who has been suspended, pending expulsion, pursuant to
Education Code 48915. However, if the recommended expulsion is not implemented or the expulsion itself is
suspended, then a student may be required to perform community service for the resulting suspension pursuant to
this section. (Education Code 48900.6)
Notice to Parents/Guardians and Students
At the beginning of the school year, the Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians, in writing, about
the availability of district rules related to discipline. (Education Code 35291, 48980)
The Superintendent or designee shall also provide written notice of the rules related to discipline to transfer students
at the time of their enrollment in the district.
