Definitions
A gifted and talented student is a student enrolled in a public school who is identified as possessing demonstrated or
potential abilities that give evidence of high performance capability in categories selected by the Board of Education.
(Education Code 52201)
A highly gifted student is one who has achieved a measured intelligence quotient of 150 or more points on an
assessment of intelligence administered by qualified personnel or has demonstrated extraordinary aptitude and
achievement in language arts, mathematics, science, or other academic subjects, as evaluated and confirmed by both
the student's teacher and principal. Highly gifted students shall generally constitute not more than one percent of
the student population. (Education Code 52201)
A special day class for gifted and talented students consists of one or more classes totaling a minimum school day
where each class: (5 CCR 3840)
1. Is composed of students identified as gifted and talented
 
2. Is designed to meet the specific academic needs of gifted and talented students for enriched or advanced
instruction and is appropriately differentiated from other classes in the same subjects at the school
 
3. Is taught by a teacher who has specific preparation, experience, personal attributes, and competencies in the
teaching of gifted children
A part-time grouping is one in which students attend classes or seminars that are organized to provided advanced or
enriched subject matter for a part of the school day and those classes are composed of identified gifted and talented
students. (5 CCR 3840)
A cluster grouping is one in which students are grouped within a regular classroom setting and receive appropriately

Prior to making a final determination of a student's eligibility, the pertinent evidence shall be evaluated by the
student's principal or designee, a classroom teacher familiar with the student's work, and, when appropriate, a

consideration, and/or a person who has in-depth understanding of the student's linguistic or cultural group, shall

shall meet as necessary to resolve any differences in assessment and recommendations. (5 CCR 3824)

3831)
