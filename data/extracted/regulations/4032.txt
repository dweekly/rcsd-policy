Definitions
Disability, with respect to an individual, is defined as any of the following: (Government Code 12926; 29 CFR 1630.2)
1. A physical or mental impairment that limits one or more of the major life activities
 
2. A record of such an impairment
 
3. Being regarded as having such an impairment
Limits shall be determined without regard to mitigating measures such as medications, assistive devices, prosthetics
or reasonable accommodations, unless the mitigating measure itself limits a major life activity. (Government Code
12926)
Essential functions are the fundamental job duties of the position the individual with a disability holds or desires. The
term does not include the marginal functions of the position. (29 CFR 1630.2)
Reasonable accommodations that an employer may need to provide in connection with modifications to the work
environment or adjustments in how and when a job is performed that enable an individual with a disability to enjoy
equal employment opportunities include, but are not limited to: (29 CFR 1630.2)
1. Making existing facilities accessible and usable
 
2. Restructuring the job duties
 
3. Offering part-time or modified work schedules
 
4. Acquiring or modifying equipment or devices
 
5. Changing tests, training materials or policies
 
6. Providing qualified readers or interpreters
 
7. Reassigning the employee to a vacant position
Qualified individual with a disability means an individual with a disability who satisfies the requisite skill, experience,
education and other job-related requirements of the employment position and who, with or without reasonable
accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position. (29 CFR 1630.2)
Undue hardship is a determination based on an individualized assessment of current circumstances that shows that a
specific reasonable accommodation would cause significant difficulty or expense. A determination of undue hardship
should be based on several factors, including: (29 CFR 1630.2)
1. The nature and net cost of the accommodation needed, taking into consideration the availability of tax credits
and deductions and/or outside funding
 
2. The overall financial resources of the facility making the reasonable accommodation, the number of persons
employed at this facility, the effect on expenses and resources of the facility, or the impact on the operations
of the facility
 
3. The overall financial resources, size, number of employees, and the number, type and location of facilities of
the district
 
4. The type of operation of the district, including the structure and functions of the workforce, the geographic
separateness, and the administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility involved in making the accommodation
 
5. The impact of the accommodation on the operation of the facility, including the impact on the ability of other
employees to perform their duties and the impact on the facility's ability to conduct business.


Requests for Reasonable Accommodation
The district designates the position specified in BP 4030 - Nondiscrimination in Employment as the coordinator of its
efforts to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and to investigate any and all related complaints.
When requesting reasonable accommodation, the employee or employee's representative shall inform the
employee's supervisor that he/she needs a change at work for a reason related to a medical condition.
When requesting reasonable accommodation during the hiring process, a job applicant shall inform the coordinator
that he/she will need a reasonable accommodation for the process.
Employees' requests for reasonable accommodation may first be considered informally by the site administrator. The
site administrator shall consult with the coordinator before any decision as to accommodation is made.
When the disability and/or the need for accommodation is not obvious, the coordinator may ask the employee to
supply reasonable documentation about his/her disability. In requesting this documentation, the coordinator shall
specify the types of information that are being sought about the employee's condition, the employee's functional
limitations and the need for reasonable accommodation. The employee may be asked to sign a limited release
allowing the district to submit a list of specific questions to the health care or vocational professional.
If the documentation submitted by the employee does not specify the existence of a qualifying disability and explain
the need for reasonable accommodation, the district may require the employee to submit to an examination by a
health care professional selected and paid for by the district.
Upon receiving a request to reasonably accommodate a qualified employee with a disability, the coordinator shall:
1. Determine the essential functions of the job
 
2. Engage in an informal, interactive process with the employee to review the request for accommodation,
identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability, identify potential means for providing
accommodation, and assess their effectiveness
 
3. Develop a plan for reasonable accommodation which is effective and allows the employee to perform the
essential functions of the job or to gain equal access to a benefit or privilege of employment and does not
impose undue hardship on the district
To qualify for a job, an individual shall not pose a significant risk of substantial harm to himself/herself or others in
the workplace which cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. (29 CFR 1630.2)
The determination of whether an individual poses a significant risk of substantial harm to himself/herself or others
shall be made on a case-by-case basis and shall be based on objective, factual evidence, taking into consideration the
duration of the risks, the nature and severity of the potential harm, the likelihood that the potential harm will occur
and the imminence of potential harm. (29 CFR 1630.2)
The coordinator may confer with the site administrator, the district medical advisor and/or other district staff before
making a final decision as to the accommodation.
Appeal Process
If the employee or applicant is not satisfied with the decision of the coordinator, he/she may appeal in writing to the
Superintendent or designee. This appeal shall be made within 10 working days of receiving the decision and shall
include:
1. A clear, concise statement of the reasons for the appeal
 
2. A statement of the specific remedy sought
The Superintendent or designee shall consult with the coordinator and review the appeal, together with any available
supporting documents. The Superintendent or designee shall give the employee or applicant his/her decision within
15 working days of receiving the appeal.
Any further appeal for reasonable accommodation shall be considered a complaint concerning discrimination in
employment and may be taken to the Board of Education in accordance with the district's procedure for such
complaints.
