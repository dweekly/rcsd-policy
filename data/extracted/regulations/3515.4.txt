Reports
District employees shall report all damage or loss of school property to the principal or designee immediately after
such damage or loss is discovered. In those instances in which insurance reimbursement may be involved, the
principal or designee shall contact the appropriate district official.
Investigation
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that a complete investigation is conducted at the site where the
vandalism occurred.
The principal or designee shall conduct a complete investigation of any instance of damage or loss of school
property. The investigation shall be carried out in cooperation with law enforcement officials when appropriate.
Recovery of Damages
When the person causing the damage or loss has been identified and the costs of repair, replacement or cleanup
determined, the Superintendent or designee shall take all practical and reasonable steps to recover these costs,
including consulting district's legal counsel if necessary. Reasonable steps may include the filing of a civil complaint in
a court of competent jurisdiction to recover damages from the responsible person.
If the responsible person is a minor, recovery may be sought from the minor's custodial parent/guardian in
accordance with Education Code 48904.
Damages may include the cost of repair or replacement of the property, the payment of any reward, interest, court
costs and all other damages as provided by law.
Payment of Reward
When authorized according to Board of Education policy, the reward shall be paid to the party who provides
information sufficient to identify and apprehend the person or persons subsequently found responsible for the
damage or loss. If more than one informant provides information, the reward shall be divided among the informants.
The Superintendent or designee shall determine who is entitled to what portion of the reward. The identity of the
informant shall be considered confidential and shall not be made public by the district.
In order to protect students while they are traveling to and from school, or attending school or a school-related
activity, the Board of Education believes it is important that the district respond appropriately when a law
enforcement agency notifies the district about registered sex offenders who may reside or work within district
boundaries.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish an ongoing relationship with law enforcement officials to coordinate
the receipt and dissemination of such information. To the extent authorized by law, the Superintendent or designee
also shall establish procedures for notifying appropriate staff as necessary.
To protect the district and its employees from liability, employees shall disseminate sex offender information in good
faith, and only in the manner and to the extent authorized by the law enforcement agency.
The Superintendent or designee may annually notify parents/guardians of the availability of information about
registered sex offenders on the Department of Justice's Internet website.
