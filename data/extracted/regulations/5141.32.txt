Comprehensive Health Screening for Grades K-1
The parent/guardian of a student in kindergarten or first grade shall submit to the Superintendent or designee a
certification form developed by the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) and signed by the
student's health examiner certifying that the student has completed a comprehensive health screening within 18
months prior to entry into first grade or within 90 days thereafter. (Health and Safety Code 124040, 124085)
The Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians of all kindergarten students of the requirement to
obtain a health screening and of the availability of the Child Health and Disability Prevention (CHDP) program
established pursuant to Health and Safety Code 124025-124110 to assist eligible low-income families in obtaining
the health screening. (Health and Safety Code 124100)
The notice and certification form shall be included with the notification of immunization requirements provided to
parents/guardians prior to their child's enrollment in kindergarten and shall encourage completion of the health
screening simultaneously with immunizations. The notice shall also be provided to the parent/guardian of any
student who is enrolling in first grade without having attended kindergarten in the district.
In lieu of the certification, the parent/guardian may submit a waiver on a form developed by DHCS indicating that
he/she does not want or is unable to obtain a health screening. If the waiver indicates that the parent/guardian was
unable to obtain the services, the reasons should be included in the waiver. (Health and Safety Code 124085)
The waiver form shall be provided to a parent/guardian upon request.
The completed certification form or the waiver shall be maintained in the student's health file or cumulative record.
(5 CCR 432)
During the first 90 days of the school year, the Superintendent or designee may contact any parent/guardian of a
first-grade student who has not provided either the certification form or the waiver to ensure that the
parent/guardian understands the health screening requirement and, if appropriate, his/her possible eligibility for the
CHDP program.
The Superintendent or designee shall exclude from school, for not more than five school days, any first-grade student
who does not present evidence of a health screening or a waiver on or before the 90th day after entering first grade.
The exclusion shall begin on the 91st day after the student's entrance into the first grade, or if school is not in
session, then on the next succeeding school day. (Health and Safety Code 124105)
The Superintendent or designee may exempt a student from exclusion when his/her parents/guardians have been
contacted at least twice between the first day and the 90th day after the student's enrollment in first grade and the
parents/guardians refuse to provide either a certification form or a waiver. (Health and Safety Code 124105)
Oral Health Assessment for Grades K-1
No later than May 31 of the relevant school year, the parent/guardian of a kindergarten student, or first-grade
student who was not previously enrolled in kindergarten in a public school, shall certify that the student has received
an oral health assessment. The oral health assessment shall have been performed by a licensed dentist or other
authorized dental health professional no earlier than 12 months prior to the date of the student's initial enrollment.
The parent/guardian shall submit to the Superintendent or designee a California Department of Education
standardized form which has been completed and signed by the dental health professional. (Education Code
49452.8)
The Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians of the oral health assessment requirement. The
notification shall, at a minimum, consist of a letter that includes all of the following: (Education Code 49452.8)
1. An explanation of the administrative requirements of the law
 
2. Information on the importance of primary teeth
 
3. Information on the importance of oral health to overall health and to learning

6. A statement of privacy applicable under state and federal laws and regulations
The notification and certification form shall be provided to parents/guardians when they register their child for
school.
The student may be excused from complying with the oral health assessment if his/her parent/guardian indicates on
the standardized form that it could not be completed for any of the following reasons: (Education Code 49452.8)
1. Completion of an assessment poses an undue financial burden on the parent/guardian.
 
2. The parent/guardian lacks access to a licensed dentist or other dental health professional.
 
3. The parent/guardian does not consent to an assessment.
Students who are not assessed, or for whom the parents/guardians fail to return the standardized form, shall not be
excluded from school attendance.
By December 31 of each year, the Superintendent or designee shall report data on oral health assessments to the
county office of education in accordance with Education Code 49452.8.
The report shall also be provided to the Board of Education. The identity of any student shall not be included in the
