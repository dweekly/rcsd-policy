School Site Councils
When required for participation in any categorical program, each district school shall establish a school site council or
advisory committee. (Education Code 41507, 41572, 52852, 64001)
The school site council shall be composed of the following: (Education Code 41507, 41572, 52852)
1. The principal
 
2. Teachers selected by the school's teachers
 
3. Other school personnel chosen by the school's other personnel
 
4. Parents/guardians of students attending the school chosen by other such parents/guardians, or community
members chosen by the parents/guardians as representatives
 
5. In secondary schools, students attending the school chosen by other such students
Half of the school site council membership shall consist of school staff, the majority of whom shall be classroom
teachers. For elementary school site councils, the remaining half shall be parents/guardians or parent/guardian
representatives. For secondary school site councils, the remaining half shall be equal numbers of parents/guardians
(or parent/guardian representatives) and students. (Education Code 41507, 41572, 52852)
A district employee may serve as a parent/guardian representative on the site council of the school his/her child
attends, provided the employee does not work at that school. (Education Code 52852)
The bylaws of each school site council shall include the method of selecting members and officers, terms of office,
responsibilities of council members, time commitment, and a policy of nondiscrimination.
School site councils may function on behalf of other committees in accordance with law. (Education Code
52055.620, 52176, 52870, 54425; 5 CCR 3932)
School site councils shall operate in accordance with procedural meeting requirements established in Education Code
35147.
Single Plan for Student Achievement
In order for a school to participate in any state or federal categorical program specified in Education Code 64000,
the school site council shall approve, annually review, and update a single plan for student achievement (SPSA). If the
school does not have a school site council, a schoolwide advisory group or school support group conforming to the
composition requirements of the school site council listed above shall fulfill these responsibilities. (Education Code
64001)
The SPSA shall be developed with the review, advice, and certification of any applicable school advisory committees.
(Education Code 64001)
Such groups may include, but are not limited to, a parent advisory committee established to review and comment on
the district's local control and accountability plan (LCAP); advisory committees established for English learner and
special education programs; Western Association of Schools and Colleges leadership teams; district or school liaison
teams for schools identified for program improvement; and other committees established by the school or district.
The SPSA shall be aligned with the district's LCAP and school goals for improving student achievement and shall be
based on an analysis of verifiable state data identified pursuant to law, and any other data developed by the district
to measure student achievement. (Education Code 64001)
The SPSA shall, at a minimum: (Education Code 64001)
1. Address how funds provided to the school through categorical programs will be used to improve the academic
performance of all students to the level of the performance goals established by the API
Board Policy Manual
Redwood City School District

Policy Reference Disclaimer:
 
2. Identify the school's means of evaluating progress toward accomplishing those goals
 
3. Identify how state and federal law governing these programs will be implemented
In addition to meeting the requirements common to all applicable school plans, the SPSA shall address the content
required by law for each individual categorical program in which the school participates.
In developing or revising the SPSA, the school site council or other schoolwide advisory group or school support
group shall:
1. Analyze student achievement data. Using measures of student academic performance, the school shall identify
significant patterns of low performance in particular content areas, student groups, and/or individual students
and determine which data summaries to include in the plan as most informative and relevant to school goals.
 
2. Assess the effectiveness of the school's instructional program in relation to the analysis of student data.
 
3. Identify a limited number of achievement goals and key improvement strategies to achieve the goals. School
goals shall reflect the needs identified at the school site while aligning with goals identified in federally
required district plans. The school shall specify the student group(s) on which each goal is focused, the
methods or practices that will be used to reach the goal, and the criteria that will be used to determine if the
goal is achieved.
 
4. Define timelines, personnel responsible, proposed expenditures, and funding sources to implement the SPSA.
The school site council or other schoolwide group shall approve the proposed SPSA at a meeting for which public
notice has been posted and then submit the SPSA to the Board of Education for approval. (Education Code 35147,
64001)
The school site council or other schoolwide group shall monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the single
plan and modify any activities that prove ineffective. At least once per year, the principal or designee shall evaluate
results of improvement efforts and report to the Board, school site council, advisory committees, and other
interested parties regarding progress toward school goals.
The school site council or other schoolwide group may amend the SPSA at any time. Any revisions that would
substantively change the academic programs funded through the consolidated application shall be submitted to the
Board for approval.
