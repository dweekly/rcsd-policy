The Board of Education may dispose of personal property belonging to the district by any of the following methods:
1. If the Board members attending a meeting unanimously agree that the property is worth no more than $2,500,
the Board may designate any district employee to sell the property without advertising. (Education Code
17546)
 
2. The Board may advertise for bids and either sell the property to the highest responsible bidder or reject all
bids. (Education Code 17545)
Notice for bids shall be posted in at least three public places in the district for at least two weeks or published
at least once a week for at least two weeks in a newspaper having a general circulation in the district and, if
possible, published within the district. (Education Code 17545)
Property for which no qualified bid has been received may be sold, without further advertising, by the
Superintendent or designee. (Education Code 17546)
 
3. The Board may authorize the sale of the property by means of a public auction conducted by district
employees, employees of other public agencies, or by contract with a private auction firm. Notice related to
the auction shall be posted or published as described in item #2 above. (Education Code 17545)
 
4. Without advertising for bids, the Board may sell the property to agencies of federal, state or local government,
to any other school district, or to any agency eligible under the federal surplus property law (40 USC 484(j)(3)).
In such cases, the sale price shall equal the cost of the property plus estimated cost of purchasing, storing and
handling. (Education Code 17540)
 
5. Without advertising for bids, the Board may sell or lease the property to agencies of federal, state or local
government or to any other school district. In such cases, the price and terms of the sale or lease shall be fixed
by the Board and approved by the County Superintendent of Schools. (Education Code 17542)
 
6. If the Board members attending a meeting unanimously find that the value of the property is insufficient to
defray the costs of arranging a sale, the property may be donated to a charitable organization deemed
appropriate by the Board or may be disposed of by dumping. (Education Code 17546)
Money received from the sale of surplus property shall be either deposited in the district reserve or general fund or
credited to the fund from which the original purchase was made. (Education Code 17547)
Instructional Materials
Surplus or undistributed obsolete instructional materials that are usable for educational purposes may be donated to
any Board of Education, county free library or other state institution; any United States public agency or institution;
any nonprofit charitable organization; or children or adults in California or foreign countries for the purpose of
increasing literacy. They also may be sold to any organization that agrees to use the materials for educational
purposes. (Education Code 60510)
Any organization, agency or institution receiving obsolete instructional materials from the district shall certify to the
Board that it agrees to use the materials for educational purposes and make no charge to any persons to whom the
materials are given or lent. (Education Code 60511)
At least 60 days before disposing of these instructional materials, the Board shall notify the public of its intention to
do so through a public service announcement on a local television station, in a local newspaper, or by another means
the Board believes will most effectively reach the entities described above. The Board shall also permit
representatives of these entities and members of the public to address the Board regarding the distribution of these
materials.

specified above may be disposed of by either of the following: (Education Code 60530)
