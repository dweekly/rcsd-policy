6. Provide to students a handbook that contains age-appropriate information that clearly describes the district's
nondiscrimination policy, procedures for filing a complaint, and resources available to students who feel that
they have been the victim of any such behavior.
 
7. Annually notify all students and parents/guardians of the district's nondiscrimination policy, including its
responsibility to provide a safe, nondiscriminatory school environment for all students. The notice shall inform
students and parents/guardians that they may request to meet with the compliance officer to determine how
best to accommodate or resolve concerns that may arise from the district's implementation of its
nondiscrimination policies. The notice shall also inform all students and parents/guardians that, to the extent
possible, the district will address any individual student's interests and concerns in private.
 
8. Ensure that students and parents/guardians, including those with limited English proficiency, are notified of
how to access the relevant information provided in the district's nondiscrimination policy and related
complaint procedures, notices, and forms in a language they can understand.

unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, or bullying, against a student is
required to intervene if it is safe to do so.
 
11. At the beginning of each school year, inform each principal or designee of the district's responsibility to
provide appropriate assistance or resources to protect students from threatened or potentially discriminatory

Nondiscrimination/Harassment. As needed, these actions may include any of the following:
1. Removing vulgar or offending graffiti
 
2. Providing training to students, staff, and parents/guardians about how to recognize unlawful discrimination,
how to report it or file a complaint, and how to respond
 
3. Disseminating and/or summarizing the district's policy and regulation regarding unlawful discrimination

4. Consistent with laws regarding the confidentiality of student and personnel records, communicating to

discrimination that they knew was not true
Process for Initiating and Responding to Complaints
Students who feel that they have been subjected to unlawful discrimination described above or in district policy are
strongly encouraged to immediately contact the compliance officer, principal, or any other staff member. In addition,
any student who observes any such incident is strongly encouraged to report the incident to the compliance officer
or principal, whether or not the alleged victim files a complaint.
Any school employee who observes an incident of unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment,
intimidation, retaliation, or bullying, or to whom such an incident is reported shall report the incident to the
compliance officer or principal within a school day, whether or not the alleged victim files a complaint.
Any school employee who witnesses an incident of unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment,
intimidation, retaliation, or bullying, shall immediately intervene to stop the incident when it is safe to do so.
(Education Code 234.1)
When a report of unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, retaliation, or bullying, is
made to or received by the principal or compliance officer, the principal or compliance officer shall notify the student
or parent/guardian of the right to file a formal complaint in accordance with AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint
Procedures or, for complaints of sexual harassment that meet the federal Title IX definition, AR 5145.71 - Title IX
Sexual Harassment Complaint Procedures. Once notified verbally or in writing, the principal or compliance officer
shall begin the investigation and shall implement immediate measures necessary to stop the discrimination and
ensure that all students have access to the educational program and a safe school environment. Any interim
measures adopted to address unlawful discrimination shall, to the extent possible, not disadvantage the complainant
or a student who is the victim of the alleged unlawful discrimination.
Any report or complaint alleging unlawful discrimination by the principal, compliance officer, or any other person to
whom a report would ordinarily be made or complaint filed shall instead be made to or filed with the Superintendent
or designee who shall determine how the complaint will be investigated.
Issues Unique to Intersex, Nonbinary, Transgender and Gender-Nonconforming Students
Gender identity of a student means the student's gender-related identity, appearance, or behavior as determined from
the student's internal sense of their gender, whether or not that gender-related identity, appearance, or behavior is
different from that traditionally associated with the student's physiology or assigned sex at birth.
Gender expression means a student's gender-related appearance and behavior, whether stereotypically associated
with the student's assigned sex at birth. (Education Code 210.7)
Gender transition refers to the process in which a student changes from living and identifying as the sex assigned to
the student at birth to living and identifying as the sex that corresponds to the student's gender identity.
Gender-nonconforming student means a student whose gender expression differs from stereotypical expectations.
Intersex student means a student with natural bodily variations in anatomy, hormones, chromosomes, and other traits
that differ from expectations generally associated with female and male bodies.
Nonbinary student means a student whose gender identity falls outside the traditional conception of strictly either
female or male, regardless of whether or not the student identifies as transgender, was born with intersex traits, uses
gender-neutral pronouns, or uses agender, genderqueer, pangender, gender-nonconforming, gender variant, or such
other more specific term to describe their gender.
Transgender student means a student whose gender identity is different from the gender they were assigned at birth.
The district prohibits acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility that are based on sex,

gender identity, or gender expression, or that have the purpose or effect of producing a negative impact on the
student's academic performance or of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive educational environment,
regardless of whether the acts are sexual in nature. Examples of the types of conduct which are prohibited in the
district and which may constitute gender-based harassment include, but are not limited to:
1. Refusing to address a student by a name and the pronouns consistent with their gender identity
 
2. Disciplining or disparaging a student or excluding them from participating in activities for behavior or
appearance that is consistent with their gender identity or that does not conform to stereotypical notions of
masculinity or femininity, as applicable
 
3. Blocking a student's entry to the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity
 
4. Taunting a student because they participate in an athletic activity more typically favored by a student of the
other sex
 
5. Revealing a student's gender identity status to individuals who do not have a legitimate need for the
information, without the student's consent
 
6. Using gender-specific slurs
 
7. Physically assaulting a student motivated by hostility toward them because of their gender, gender identity, or
gender expression
The district's uniform complaint procedures (AR 1312.3) or Title IX sexual harassment procedures (AR 5145.71), as
applicable, shall be used to report and resolve complaints alleging discrimination against intersex, nonbinary,
transgender and gender-nonconforming students.
Examples of bases for complaints include, but are not limited to, the above list, as well as improper rejection by the
district of a student's asserted gender identity, denial of access to facilities that correspond with a student's gender
identity, improper disclosure of a student's gender identity, discriminatory enforcement of a dress code, and other
instances of gender- based harassment.
To ensure that intersex, nonbinary, transgender and gender-nonconforming students are afforded the same rights,
benefits, and protections provided to all students by law and Board policy, the district shall address each situation on
a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the following guidelines:
1. Right to privacy: A student's intersex, nonbinary, transgender, or gender-nonconforming status is the student's
private information. The district shall develop strategies to prevent unauthorized disclosure of students'
private information. Such strategies may include, but are not limited to, collecting or maintaining information
about student gender only when relevant to the educational program or activity, protecting or revealing a
student's gender identity as necessary to protect the health or safety of the student, and keeping a student's
unofficial record separate from the official record.
The district shall only disclose the information to others with the student's prior written consent, except when
the disclosure is otherwise required by law or when the district has compelling evidence that disclosure is
necessary to preserve the student's physical or mental well-being. In any case, the district shall only allow
disclosure of a student's personally identifiable information to employees with a legitimate educational interest
as determined by the district pursuant to 34 CFR 99.31. Any district employee to whom a student's intersex,
nonbinary, transgender, or gender-nonconforming status is disclosed shall keep the student's information
confidential. When disclosure of a student's gender identity is made to a district employee by a student, the
employee shall seek the student's permission to notify the compliance officer. If the student refuses to give
permission, the employee shall keep the student's information confidential, unless the employee is required to
disclose or report the student's information pursuant to this administrative regulation, and shall inform the
student that honoring the student's request may limit the district's ability to meet the student's needs related
to the student's status as an intersex, nonbinary, transgender, or gender-nonconforming student. If the student
permits the employee to notify the compliance officer, the employee shall do so within three school days.
As appropriate given the student's need for support, the compliance officer may discuss with the student any
need to disclose the student's intersex, nonbinary, transgender or gender- nonconformity status or gender
identity or gender expression to their parents/guardians and/or others, including other students, teacher(s), or
other adults on campus. The district shall offer support services, such as counseling, to students who wish to


inform their parents/guardians of their status and desire assistance in doing so.
 
2. Determining a Student's Gender Identity: The compliance officer shall accept the student's assertion of their
gender identity and begin to treat the student consistent with their gender identity unless district personnel
present a credible and supportable basis for believing that the student's assertion is for an improper purpose.
 
3. Addressing a Student's Transition Needs: The compliance officer shall arrange a meeting with the student and,
if appropriate, their parents/guardians to identify and develop strategies for ensuring that the student's access
to education programs and activities is maintained. The meeting shall discuss the intersex, nonbinary,
transgender or gender-nonconforming student's rights and how those rights may affect and be affected by the
rights of other students and shall address specific subjects related to the student's access to facilities and to
academic or educational support programs, services, or activities, including, but not limited to, sports and other
competitive endeavors. In addition, the compliance officer shall identify specific school site employee(s) to
whom the student may report any problem related to their status as an intersex, nonbinary, transgender or
gender-nonconforming individual, so that prompt action can be taken to address it. Alternatively, if appropriate
and desired by the student, the school may form a support team for the student that will meet periodically to
assess whether the arrangements for the student are meeting their educational needs and providing equal
access to programs and activities, educate appropriate staff about the student's transition, and serve as a
resource to the student to better protect the student from gender-based discrimination.
 
4. Accessibility to Sex-Segregated Facilities, Programs, and Activities: When the district maintains sex-segregated
facilities, such as restrooms and locker rooms, or offers sex-segregated programs and activities, such as
physical education classes, intermural sports, and interscholastic athletic programs, students shall be permitted
to access facilities and participate in programs and activities consistent with their gender identity. To address
any student's privacy concerns in using sex-segregated facilities, the district shall offer available options such
as a gender-neutral or single-use restroom or changing area, a bathroom stall with a door, an area in the locker
room separated by a curtain or screen, access to a staff member's office, or use of the locker room before or
after the other students. However, the district shall not require a student to utilize these options because the
student is intersex, nonbinary, transgender or gender-nonconforming. In addition, a student shall be permitted
to participate in accordance with their gender identity in other circumstances where students are separated by
gender, such as for class discussions, yearbook pictures, and field trips. A student's right to participate in a sex-
segregated activity in accordance with their gender identity shall not render invalid or inapplicable any other
eligibility rule established for participation in the activity.
 
5. Upon each student's enrollment, the district is required to maintain a mandatory permanent student record
(official record) that includes the student's gender and legal name.
A student's legal name as entered on the mandatory student record required pursuant to 5 CCR 432 shall only
be changed with proper documentation. A student's gender as entered on the student's official record required
pursuant to 5 CCR 432 shall only be changed with written authorization of a parent/guardian having legal
custody of the student. (Education Code 49061)
However, when proper documentation or authorization, as applicable, is not submitted with a request to
change a student's legal name or gender, any change to the student's record shall be limited to the student's
unofficial records such as attendance sheets, report cards, and school identification.
 
6. Names and Pronouns: If a student so chooses, district personnel shall be required to address the student by a
name and the pronoun(s) consistent with their gender identity, without the necessity of a court order or a
change to their official district record. However, inadvertent slips or honest mistakes by district personnel in
the use of the student's name and/or consistent pronouns will, in general, not constitute a violation of this
administrative regulation or the accompanying district policy.
 
7. Uniforms/Dress Code: A student has the right to dress in a manner consistent with their gender identity,
subject to any dress code adopted on a school site.
