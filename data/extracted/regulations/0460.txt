Goals and Actions Addressing State and Local Priorities
The district's local control and accountability plan (LCAP) shall include, for the district and each district
school: (Education Code 52060)
1. A description of the annual goals established for all students and for each numerically significant subgroup as
defined in Education Code 52052, including ethnic subgroups, socioeconomically disadvantaged students,
English learners, students with disabilities, foster youth, and homeless students. The LCAP shall identify goals
for each of the following state priorities:
 
a. The degree to which district teachers are appropriately assigned in accordance with Education Code
44258.9 and fully credentialed in the subject areas and for the students they are teaching; every district
student has sufficient access to standards-aligned instructional materials as determined pursuant to
Education Code 60119; and school facilities are maintained in good repair as specified in Education Code

b. Implementation of the academic content and performance standards adopted by the State Board of
Education (SBE), including how the programs and services will enable English learners to access the
Common Core State Standards and the English language development standards for purposes of gaining
academic content knowledge and English language proficiency
 
c. Parent/guardian involvement, including efforts the district makes to seek parent/guardian input in
district and school site decision making and how the district will promote parent/guardian participation
in programs for unduplicated students, as defined in Education Code 42238.02 and Board policy, and
students with disabilities
 
d. Student achievement, as measured by all of the following as applicable:
 
i. Statewide assessments of student achievement
 
ii. The percentage of English learners who make progress toward English proficiency as measured by
the SBE-certified assessment of English proficiency
 
iii. The English learner reclassification rate
 
e. School climate, as measured by student suspension and expulsion rates and other local measures,
including surveys of students, parents/guardians, and teachers on the sense of safety and school
connectedness, as applicable
 
f. The extent to which students have access to and are enrolled in a broad course of study that includes all
of the subject areas described in Education Code 51210 and 51220, as applicable, including the
programs and services developed and provided to unduplicated students and students with disabilities,
and the programs and services that are provided to benefit these students as a result of supplemental
and concentration grant funding pursuant to Education Code 42238.02 and 42238.03
 
g. Student outcomes, if available, in the subject areas described in Education Code 51210 and 51220, as
applicable
 
2. Any goals identified for any local priorities established by the Board.
 
3. A description of the specific actions the district will take during each year of the LCAP to achieve the identified
goals, including the enumeration of any specific actions necessary for that year to correct any deficiencies in
regard to the state and local priorities specified in items #1-2 above. Such actions shall not supersede
provisions of existing collective bargaining agreements within the district.
For purposes of the descriptions required by items #1-3 above, the Board may consider qualitative
information, including, but not limited to, findings that result from any school quality reviews conducted



pursuant to Education Code 52052 or any other reviews. (Education Code 52060)
For any local priorities addressed in the LCAP, the Board and Superintendent or designee shall identify and
include in the LCAP the method for measuring the district's progress toward achieving those goals. 
(Education Code 52060)
To the extent practicable, data reported in the LCAP shall be reported in a manner consistent with how
information is reported on a school accountability report card. (Education Code 52060)
Increase or Improvement in Services for Unduplicated Students
The LCAP shall demonstrate how the district will increase or improve services for unduplicated students at
least in proportion to the increase in funds apportioned on the basis of the number and concentration of
unduplicated students. (5 CCR 15494-15496)
When the district expends supplemental and/or concentration grant funds on a districtwide or schoolwide
basis during the year for which the LCAP is adopted, the district's LCAP shall: (5 CCR 15496)
1. Identify those services that are being funded and provided on a districtwide or schoolwide basis
 
2. Describe how services are principally directed towards, and are effective in, meeting the district's goals
for unduplicated students in the state priority areas and any local priority areas
 
3. If the enrollment of unduplicated students is less than 55 percent of district enrollment or less than 40
percent of school enrollment, describe how these services are the most effective use of the funds to
meet the district's goals for its unduplicated students in the state priority areas and any local priority
areas. The description shall provide the basis for this determination, including, but not limited to, any
alternatives considered and any supporting research, experiences, or educational theory.
Annual Updates
On or before July 1 of each year, the LCAP shall be updated using the template adopted by the SBE and shall
include all of the following: (Education Code 52061)
1. A review of any changes in the applicability of the goals described in the existing LCAP pursuant to the section
"Goals and Actions Addressing State and Local Priorities" above
 
2. A review of the progress toward the goals included in the existing LCAP, an assessment of the
effectiveness of the specific actions described in the existing LCAP toward achieving the goals, and a
description of changes to the specific actions the district will make as a result of the review and
assessment
 
3. A listing and description of the expenditures for the fiscal year implementing the specific actions
included in the LCAP and the changes to the specific actions made as a result of the reviews and
assessment required by items #1-2 above
 
4. A listing and description of expenditures for the fiscal year that will serve unduplicated students and
students redesignated as fluent English proficient
Availability of the Plan
The Superintendent or designee shall post the LCAP and any updates or revisions to the LCAP on the
district's web site. (Education Code 52065)
