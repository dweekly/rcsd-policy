44258.9 and fully credentialed in the subject areas and for the students they are teaching; every district
student has sufficient access to standards-aligned instructional materials as determined pursuant to
Education Code 60119; and school facilities are maintained in good repair as specified in Education Code

b. Implementation of the academic content and performance standards adopted by the State Board of
Education (SBE), including how the programs and services will enable English learners to access the
Common Core State Standards and the English language development standards for purposes of gaining
academic content knowledge and English language proficiency
 
c. Parent/guardian involvement, including efforts the district makes to seek parent/guardian input in
district and school site decision making and how the district will promote parent/guardian participation
in programs for unduplicated students, as defined in Education Code 42238.02 and Board policy, and
students with disabilities
 
d. Student achievement, as measured by all of the following as applicable:

including surveys of students, parents/guardians, and teachers on the sense of safety and school
connectedness, as applicable
 
f. The extent to which students have access to and are enrolled in a broad course of study that includes all
of the subject areas described in Education Code 51210 and 51220, as applicable, including the
programs and services developed and provided to unduplicated students and students with disabilities,
and the programs and services that are provided to benefit these students as a result of supplemental
and concentration grant funding pursuant to Education Code 42238.02 and 42238.03
 
g. Student outcomes, if available, in the subject areas described in Education Code 51210 and 51220, as

pursuant to Education Code 52052 or any other reviews. (Education Code 52060)
For any local priorities addressed in the LCAP, the Board and Superintendent or designee shall identify and
include in the LCAP the method for measuring the district's progress toward achieving those goals. 
(Education Code 52060)
To the extent practicable, data reported in the LCAP shall be reported in a manner consistent with how
information is reported on a school accountability report card. (Education Code 52060)
Increase or Improvement in Services for Unduplicated Students
The LCAP shall demonstrate how the district will increase or improve services for unduplicated students at
least in proportion to the increase in funds apportioned on the basis of the number and concentration of
unduplicated students. (5 CCR 15494-15496)
When the district expends supplemental and/or concentration grant funds on a districtwide or schoolwide
basis during the year for which the LCAP is adopted, the district's LCAP shall: (5 CCR 15496)
1. Identify those services that are being funded and provided on a districtwide or schoolwide basis
 
2. Describe how services are principally directed towards, and are effective in, meeting the district's goals
for unduplicated students in the state priority areas and any local priority areas
 
3. If the enrollment of unduplicated students is less than 55 percent of district enrollment or less than 40
percent of school enrollment, describe how these services are the most effective use of the funds to
meet the district's goals for its unduplicated students in the state priority areas and any local priority
areas. The description shall provide the basis for this determination, including, but not limited to, any
alternatives considered and any supporting research, experiences, or educational theory.
Annual Updates
On or before July 1 of each year, the LCAP shall be updated using the template adopted by the SBE and shall
include all of the following: (Education Code 52061)
1. A review of any changes in the applicability of the goals described in the existing LCAP pursuant to the section
"Goals and Actions Addressing State and Local Priorities" above
 
2. A review of the progress toward the goals included in the existing LCAP, an assessment of the
effectiveness of the specific actions described in the existing LCAP toward achieving the goals, and a
description of changes to the specific actions the district will make as a result of the review and
assessment
 
3. A listing and description of the expenditures for the fiscal year implementing the specific actions
included in the LCAP and the changes to the specific actions made as a result of the reviews and
assessment required by items #1-2 above
 
4. A listing and description of expenditures for the fiscal year that will serve unduplicated students and
students redesignated as fluent English proficient
