Air Quality
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the following measures are taken in order to reduce indoor air
contaminants:
1. Heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems shall be operated, inspected and maintained in accordance
with 8 CCR 5142-5143. School buildings shall be inspected annually to ensure they have adequate ventilation
systems, which are properly maintained so as to preclude the buildup of mold, mildew, and other air
contaminants. Filters shall be changed as needed.
 
2. Indoor painting of school buildings shall be limited to those times when school is not in session.
 
3. Low-emission cleaning products shall be used whenever possible, and custodial duties that require polluting
products shall be performed after classes are dismissed.
 
4. Paints, adhesives and solvents shall be used and stored in well-ventilated areas; these items shall be purchased
in small quantities to avoid storage exposure.
 
5. Exterior wall and foundation cracks and openings shall be sealed as soon as possible, to control exposure to
radon.
 
6. Water-damaged ceiling tiles, carpet, and other building materials shall be removed as soon as practicable.
 
7. Plain water or soap and water shall be used as cleaning agents; aerosols, including air fresheners, shall be
avoided.
 
8. Pest control measures shall involve the use of integrated pest management (IPM) procedures.
The following steps shall be taken to minimize potential exposure to lead:
1. Painted surfaces shall be kept intact whenever possible. To minimize lead dust during maintenance operations,
a tarp or plastic shall be placed under paint removal operations to collect old paint debris, paint shall be
dampened before removing it with a scraper, nearby surfaces shall be cleaned with a wet mop or cloth after
the job is completed, a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) attachment may be used on power sanders, and
clean-up may be conducted with HEPA vacuums to remove lead dust. An open flame shall not be used to
remove old paint.
 
2. Soil with high lead content may be covered with grass, other plantings, concrete or asphalt. Children's access
to bare soil shall be limited.
 
3. Lead exposure hazards shall be evaluated before any renovation or remodeling is begun, and children shall not
be allowed in or near buildings in which these activities may create lead dust. Contractors and workers shall
comply with state and federal standards related to the handling and disposal of lead debris and the clean-up
and containment dust within the construction area.
 
4. The Superintendent or designee may provide parents/guardians and students with information about the
prevention of lead poisoning.
 
5. Remedial action to abate existing lead hazards shall be taken only by personnel qualified in accordance with
law. (Education Code 32243)
Asbestos Testing and Abatement
Maintenance staff shall be trained in the location, identification, proper cleaning and ongoing maintenance of
asbestos-containing materials and in the removal and decontamination of small amounts of such materials when
needed to repair pipes or perform similar duties. Extensive asbestos abatement work shall be completed by state-
certified asbestos abatement contractors in compliance with state and federal standards.



The district's complete, updated management plan for material containing asbestos in school buildings shall be
available for inspection in district and school offices during normal business hours. Parent, teacher and employee
organizations shall annually be informed of the availability of this plan. (40 CFR 763.93)
Other Environmental Safety Precautions
Principals or their designees shall enforce school rules designed to:
1. Prevent the accumulation of flammable, noxious or otherwise dangerous materials unless adequate safeguards
are provided
 
2. Keep all school facilities free of debris
 
3. Keep walkways at all times open to pedestrian traffic and clear of obstructions
