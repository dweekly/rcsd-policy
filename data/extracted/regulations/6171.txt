Parent Involvement Policy
The local governing board of each local educational agency (LEA), or agency, receiving Title I, Part A funding shall
establish and implement a written parent and family engagement policy and program.
Each LEA receiving Title I, Part A funding shall develop jointly with, agree on with, and distribute to, parents and
family members of participating children, a written parent and family engagement policy which shall be incorporated
into the LEA level plan, establish the agency's expectations and objectives for meaningful parent and family
involvement, and describe how the LEA shall carry out the following requirements:
Involve parents and family members in the joint development of the agency's plan, and in the development of
support and improvement plans under paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 1111(d) of the federal Elementary and
Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended by the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA).
Provide coordination, technical assistance, and other support necessary to assist and build the capacity of all
participating schools within the LEA in planning and implementing effective parent and family involvement activities
to improve student academic achievement and school performance.
Coordinate and integrate Title I, Part A parent and family engagement strategies with parent and family engagement
strategies, to the extent feasible and appropriate, with other relevant federal, state, and local laws and programs.
Conduct, with the meaningful involvement of parents and family members, an annual evaluation of the content and
effectiveness of the parent and family engagement policy in improving the academic quality of the schools served,
including identifying the following:
a. Barriers to greater participation by parents in activities authorized by this section (with particular attention to
parents who are economically disadvantaged, are disabled, have limited English proficiency, have limited
literacy, or are of any racial or ethnic minority background).
 
b. The needs of parents and family members to assist with the learning of their children, including engaging with
school personnel and teachers.
 
c. Strategies to support successful school and family interactions.
Use the findings of such evaluation to design evidence-based strategies for more effective parental involvement, and
to revise, if necessary, the parent and family engagement policy.
Involve parents in activities of the schools served under Title I, Part A to adequately represent the needs of the
population served by such agency for the purposes of developing, revising, and reviewing the parent and family
engagement policy.
The LEA parent and family engagement policy for all schools (Title I and non-Title I) in the LEA shall be consistent
with the following goals and purposes:
Engage parents and family members positively in their children's education by providing assistance and training on
topics such as state academic standards and assessments to develop knowledge and skills to use at home to support
their children's academic efforts at school and their children's development as responsible future members of our
society.
Inform parents that they can directly affect the success of their children's learning, by providing parents with
techniques and strategies that they may utilize to improve their children's academic success and to assist their
children in learning at home.
Build consistent and effective two-way communication between family members and the school so that parents and
family members may know when and how to assist their children in support of classroom learning activities.
Train teachers, school administrators, specialized instructional support personnel, and other staff to communicate
effectively with parents as equal partners.

Integrate and coordinate parent and family engagement activities with the local control and accountability plan
(LCAP), as applicable, with other programs.
The LEA receiving more than $500,000 in Title I, Part A funds shall reserve at least one percent of its allocation to
carry out parent and family engagement activities.
Parents and family members of children receiving Title I, Part A services shall be involved in the decisions regarding
how funds reserved are allotted for parental involvement activities.
Not less than 90 percent of the funds reserved shall be distributed to schools served with priority given to high-need
schools.
Funds reserved by an LEA shall be used to carry out activities and strategies consistent with the LEA's parent and
family engagement policy, including not less than one of the following:
Supporting schools and nonprofit organizations in providing professional development (PD) for LEA and school
personnel regarding parent and family engagement strategies.
Supporting programs that reach parents and family members at home, in the community, and at school.
Disseminating information on best practices focused on parent and family engagement, especially best practices for
increasing the engagement of economically disadvantaged parents and family members.
Collaborating, or providing subgrants to schools to enable such schools to collaborate, with community-based or
other organizations or employers with a record of success in improving and increasing parent and family
engagement.
Engaging in any other activities and strategies that the LEA determines are appropriate and consistent with such
agency's parent and family engagement policy.
Comparability of Services
State and local funds used in schools receiving Title I funds shall provide services that, taken as a whole, are at least
comparable to services in schools that are not receiving Title I funds or, if all district schools are receiving Title I
funds, that are substantially comparable in each school. Comparability may be determined on a school-by-school
basis or by grade span. (20 USC 6321)
The LEA shall have written assurances/policies showing the comparability of services across district schools. The
assurances shall address the following items: (1) LEA-wide salary schedule; (2) a policy to ensure equivalence among
schools in teachers, administrators, and other staff; and (3) a policy to ensure equivalence among schools in the
provision of curriculum materials and instructional supplies. (20 U.S.C Section 6321[c][2])
The LEA shall develop procedures for compliance and shall maintain records that are updated biennially to
demonstrate compliance and maintain data to support allowable exclusions of funds and/or staff from the
calculations. (20 U.S.C. Section 6321[c][3])
The comparability of services requirement shall not apply to an LEA that does not have more than one school for
each grade span. (20 U.S.C. Section 6321[c][4])
To demonstrate comparability of services among district schools:
1. The Board shall adopt and implement a districtwide salary schedule.
 
2. The ratio of students to teachers, administrators, and other staff at each Title I school shall not exceed 110
percent of the average ratio across non-Title I schools.
 
3. Salary expenditures at each Title I school shall be no less than 90 percent of the average salary expenditure
across non-Title I schools.
 
4. All district schools shall be provided with the same level of base funding per student for curriculum and
instructional materials.

5. The Superintendent or designee shall maintain records of the quantity and quality of instructional materials and
equipment at each school.
At the beginning of each school year, the Superintendent or designee shall measure comparability in accordance with
the above criteria and maintain records documenting the district's compliance. If any instances of non comparability
are identified, the Superintendent or designee shall promptly implement adjustments as needed to ensure
comparability.
Participation of Private School Students
The Superintendent or designee shall provide or contract to provide special educational services or other Title I
benefits to eligible private school students residing in a participating school attendance area. Such services and
benefits shall be provided on an equitable basis with participating public school students. (20 USC 6320, 7881)
Teachers, other educational personnel, and families of participating private school students shall have an opportunity
to participate, on an equitable basis, in parent involvement activities and professional development pursuant to 20

Each year the Superintendent or designee shall contact officials of private schools with students who reside within
district boundaries, regardless of whether the private school they attend is located within the district or whether or
not those officials have previously indicated any interest in program participation.
The Superintendent or designee shall consult, in a meaningful and timely manner, with appropriate private school
officials during the design and development of the district's Title I programs. Such consultation shall occur before the
district makes any decision that affects the opportunities of eligible private school students to participate in Title I
programs and shall include a discussion of: (20 USC 6320, 7881; 34 CFR 200.63)

third-party provider, the district will provide to private school officials a written analysis of the reasons that the
district has chosen not to use a contractor Meetings between district and private school officials shall continue
throughout implementation and assessment of services. (20 USC 6320) The Superintendent or designee shall
maintain, and shall provide to the California Department of Education upon request, a written affirmation
signed by officials of each participating private school that consultation has occurred. (20 USC 6320) If the
private school officials do not provide such affirmation within a reasonable period of time, the Superintendent
or designee shall maintain records of the consultation or the offer of consultation.
The Superintendent or designee also shall maintain records documenting that:
1. The needs of private school teachers and/or private school students were identified.
