Cautionary Notice 2010-13: AB 1610 (Ch. 724, Statutes of 2010) amended Education Code 37252.2 to relieve
districts from the obligation, until July 1, 2013, to perform any activities that are deemed to be reimbursable state
mandates under that section. As a result, certain provisions of the following policy or administrative regulation
that reflect those requirements may be suspended.
The principal at each school shall notify parents/guardians of the rights of students and parents/guardians related to
health examinations. (Education Code 48980)
A parent/guardian may annually file a written statement with the principal withholding consent to the physical
examination of his/her child. The child shall be exempt from any physical examination but shall be subject to
exclusion from attendance when contagious or infectious disease is reasonably suspected. (Education Code 49451)
Vision and Hearing Tests
Students shall have their vision and hearing tested by qualified personnel authorized by the district. (Education Code
49452, 49454)
All students shall be tested for visual acuity when they first enroll in elementary school and every three years
thereafter until the student completes grade 8. External observations of the student's eyes, visual performance and
perception shall be made by the school nurse and the classroom teacher. (Education Code 49455)
For male students, color vision shall be tested one time, after the student reaches grade 1. Results of the test shall be
entered into the student's health record. (Education Code 49455)
Evaluation of a student's vision may be waived at the parent/guardian's request if the parent/guardian presents a
certificate from either a medical doctor or an optometrist specifying the results of an examination of the student's
vision including visual acuity, and, in male students, color vision. (Education Code 49455)
Visual defects or any other defects found as a result of the vision examination shall be reported to the
parent/guardian with a request that remedial action be taken to correct or cure the defect. If made in writing, such
reports shall not include a referral to any private practitioner, and the report of a visual defect shall be made on a
form prescribed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (Education Code 49456)
The student may be referred to a public clinic or diagnostic and treatment center operated by a public hospital or by
the state, county or city department of public health. (Education Code 49456)
Scoliosis Screening
Each female student in grade 7 and each male student in grade 8 shall be screened for scoliosis. This screening shall
comply with California Department of Education standards and shall be performed by qualified personnel as
specified in law. (Education Code 49452.5)
Persons performing the screening shall not solicit, encourage or advise treatment of the student for scoliosis or any
other condition discovered in the course of the screening. (Education Code 49452.5)
The parent/guardian of any student suspected of having scoliosis shall receive a notice which includes an explanation
of scoliosis and describes the significance of treatment at an early age. This notice shall also describe the public
services available for treatment and include a referral to appropriate community resources. (Education Code
49452.5)
