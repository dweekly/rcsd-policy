Food Safety
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district's food service program meets the sanitation and safety
requirements of the California Retail Food Code as set forth in Health and Safety Code 113700-114437.
For all district schools participating in the National School Lunch and/or School Breakfast Program, the
Superintendent or designee shall implement a school food safety program for the preparation and service of school
meals which complies with the national Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles. (42 USC
1758)
The district's HACCP plan shall be in writing and shall address the components specified in Health and Safety Code
114419.1 including, but not limited to, methods for determining control measures needed to prevent hazards at each
stage of food production, monitoring of the implementation of the food safety program, establishment of corrective
actions to be taken if the proper time or temperature range is not met, training of food service employees and
supervisors on food safety issues, recordkeeping, and periodic review of the food safety program.
The Superintendent or designee shall designate at least one staff member to be responsible for verification of the
HACCP plan and shall provide the designated staff member with training in HACCP principles and the contents of
the plan. Records of the training shall be retained for the duration of employment or a period of not less than two
years, whichever is greater. In addition, the Superintendent or designee shall provide applicable HACCP training to
food service employees who work in food preparation and shall document the date, trainer, and subject of the
training. (Health and Safety Code 114419.2)
All food preparation and service areas shall be inspected in accordance with Health and Safety Code
113725-113725.1 and county regulations.
Each school participating in the National School Lunch and/or Breakfast Program shall, during each school year,
obtain a minimum of two food safety inspections conducted by the county environmental health agency. (42 USC
1758; 7 CFR 210.13, 220.7)
All schools shall post a notice indicating that the most recent inspection report is available to any interested person
upon request. (42 USC 1758; 7 CFR 210.13, 220.7; Health and Safety Code 113725.1)
The Board of Education intends that, insofar as possible, school food services shall be a self-supporting, nonprofit
program. To increase cost-effectiveness, the Superintendent or designee shall centralize and direct the purchasing of
food and supplies, the planning of menus, and the auditing of all food service accounts for the district.
Meals may be sold to students, district employees, Board members, and employees or members of the fund or
association maintaining the cafeteria. (Education Code 38082)
In addition, meals may be sold to other individuals and organizations who are on campus during meal times for a
legitimate purpose, such as classroom volunteers, parents/guardians, or student siblings.
The Superintendent or designee shall recommend meal prices for students and nonstudents for approval by the
Board. Students who are enrolled in the free or reduced-price meal programs shall receive meals free of charge or at
a reduced price in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.
Any meals served to nonstudents shall not be subsidized by federal or state reimbursements, food service revenues,
or U.S. Department of Agriculture commodities.
Program financial reports shall be presented regularly to the Board.
