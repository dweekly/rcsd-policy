Budget Adoption and Submission Process
Before adopting the district budget for the subsequent fiscal year, the Board of Education shall hold a public hearing.
An agenda for this hearing shall be posted at least 72 hours before the hearing and shall indicate the location where
the budget may be inspected. The proposed budget shall be available for public inspection at least three working
days before this hearing. (Education Code 42103, 42127)
The Superintendent or designee shall notify the County Superintendent of Schools of the location, dates, and times
at which the proposed budget may be inspected, as well as the location, date, and time of the public hearing, in
sufficient time for the County Superintendent to publish such information in a newspaper of general circulation at
least 10 days but not more than 45 days before the hearing.
During the hearing, the public may speak to the proposed budget or to any item in the budget. The hearing may
conclude when all residents who have requested to be heard have had the opportunity to speak. (Education Code
42103)
The district's budget shall be presented in the format prescribed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction.
(Education Code 42126)
The Superintendent or designee shall file the adopted budget with the County Superintendent no later than five days
after adoption or by July 1, whichever occurs first. The budget and supporting data shall be maintained and made
available for public review. (Education Code 42127)
If the County Superintendent disapproves the district's budget, the Board shall review and respond to his/her
recommendations at a public meeting on or before September 8. The response shall include any revisions to the
adopted budget and any other proposed actions to be taken as a result of those recommendations. (Education Code
42127)
Before revising the budget, the Board shall hold a second public hearing regarding the proposed revisions in
accordance with Education Code 42103. In addition, if the initial budget was disapproved by the County
Superintendent, the public hearing shall include a review by the Board and the County Superintendent of the
disapproval and the County Superintendent's recommendations. (Education Code 42127)
The revised budget and supporting data shall be maintained and made available for public review. (Education Code
42127)
Single Budget Adoption Process
No later than 45 days after the Governor signs the annual Budget Act, the Superintendent or designee shall make
available for public review any revisions in budgeted revenues and expenditures which are consequently necessary.
(Education Code 42127)
Transfers may be made from the designated fund balance or the unappropriated fund balance to any expenditure
classification or between expenditure classifications by the Board of Education on adoption of a resolution by a
majority vote.
Districts with Boards of Education
The resolution must be filed with the County Superintendent of Schools and the county auditor. (Education Code
42600)
End-of-the-Year Procedures
At the close of the school year, the Superintendent or designee may, with Board approval, identify and request the
County Superintendent of Schools to make transfers between the designated fund balance or the unappropriated
fund balance and any expenditure classification(s) or balance any budget expenditure classifications as necessary to
permit the payment of obligations incurred by the district during that school year. (Education Code 42601)
Temporary Transfers Between Classifications



The Board may direct that monies held in any fund or account may be temporarily transferred from one or more of
these accounts to another fund or account to be used for the payment of obligations of the district, with limitations
as set by Education Code 42603. The transfer shall be accounted for as temporary borrowing and shall not be
available for appropriation or be considered income to the borrowing fund or account. (Education Code 42603)
Special Reserve Funds
Upon resolution of the Board, a special reserve fund may be established for such purpose(s) as specified in the
resolution. A copy of the resolution shall be filed with the County Superintendent of Schools, as well as the county
auditor and treasurer. As necessary, the Board may amend the resolution to specify additional purposes or to
withdraw any previously designated purpose. (Education Code 42841)
The Board may expend the money in the special reserve fund for capital outlay for the purpose specified in the
resolution. In addition, unless encumbered for ongoing expenses, the Board may expend money in the fund for the
general operating purposes of the district. Any money in a special reserve fund that is maintained for purposes other
than capital outlay must be transferred into the district's general fund before it is expended. (Education Code 42842)
Deferred Maintenance Funds
Funds deposited in the district's deferred maintenance fund may be received from any source and shall only be
expended for maintenance purposes as provided for in Education Code 17582. (Education Code 17582)
Upon resolution of the Board, excess local funds deposited in the deferred maintenance fund may be transferred to
other expenditure classifications when state funds provided pursuant to Education Code 17584 and 17585 are
insufficient to fully match the local funds. The resolution shall be approved by a two-thirds vote of the Board and
filed with the County Superintendent of Schools and the county auditor. (Education Code 17583)
State School Building Funds
The Board shall transfer to the district state school building fund all funds which are required to be expended for the
project for which the apportionment was made. (Education Code 16095)
