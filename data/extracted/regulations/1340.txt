telephone number, email address, borrowing information, or use of library information resources, except when
disclosure is to persons acting within the scope of their duties in the administration of the library; to persons

the record
Inspection of Records and Requests for Copies
Any person may request a copy or inspection of any district record that is not exempt from disclosure.
Within 10 days of receiving any request to inspect or copy a district records, the Superintendent or designee shall
determine whether the request seeks copies of disclosable public records in the district's possession. The
Superintendent or designee shall promptly inform the person making the request of his/her determination and the
reasons for the decision. 
In unusual circumstances, the Superintendent or designee may extend the 10-day limit for up to 14 days by providing
written notice to the requester and setting forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a
determination is expected to be made. Unusual circumstances include the following, but only to the extent
reasonably necessary to properly process the request:
1. The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are
separate from the office processing the request
 
2. The need to search for, collect and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct
records which are demanded in a single request
 
3. The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a
substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the district
having substantial subject matter interest therein
 
4. In the case of electronic records, the need to compile data, to write programming language or a computer
program, or to construct a computer report to extract data
If the Superintendent or designee determines that the request seeks disclosable public records, the determination
shall state the estimated date and time when the records will be made available.
Public records are open to inspection at all times during district office hours. Any reasonably segregable portion of a
record shall be made available for inspection by every person requesting the record after deletion of the portions
that are exempted by law
Upon request for a copy that reasonably describes an identifiable record, an exact copy shall be promptly provided
unless it is impracticable to do so.
The Superintendent or designee shall charge an amount for copies that reflects the direct costs of duplication. 
Written requests to waive the fee shall be submitted to the Superintendent or designee.
Without charging any fees or costs, the Superintendent or designee shall allow members of the public to use their
own equipment on district premises to photograph or otherwise copy or reproduce a disclosable record as long as
the means of copy or reproduction:
1. Do not require the equipment to make physical contact with the record

Policy Reference Disclaimer:
 
2. Will not result in damage to the record
 
3. Will not result in unauthorized access to the district's computer systems or secured networks by using
software, equipment, or any other technology capable of accessing, altering, or compromising the district's
electronic records
The Superintendent or designee may impose any reasonable limit on the use of personal equipment to photograph,
copy, or reproduce a disclosable record that is necessary to protect the safety of the records, or to prevent the
copying of records from being an unreasonable burden to the orderly function of the district and its employees. The
Superintendent or designee may also impose any limit that is necessary to maintain the integrity of, or ensure the
long-term preservation of, historic or high-value records.
In addition to maintaining public records for public inspection during district office hours, the district may comply
with public records requests by posting any public record on the district's web site and, in response to a public
records request, directing the member of the
public to the location on the web site where the record can be found. However, if the member of the public is unable
to access or reproduce the record from the web site, the district shall promptly provide an exact copy of the public
record upon payment of duplication fees, if applicable, unless it is impracticable to provide an exact copy. 
(Government Code 6253)
If any person requests a public record be provided in an electronic format, the district shall make that record
available in any electronic format in which it holds the information. The district shall provide a copy of the electronic
record in the format requested as long as the requested format is one that has been used by the district to create
copies for its own use or for use by other agencies.
The cost of duplicating an electronic record shall be limited to the direct cost of producing a copy of the record in
electronic format. However, the requester shall bear the cost of producing the copy of the electronic record,
including the cost to construct the record and the cost of programming and computer services necessary to produce
the copy, under the following circumstances:
1. The electronic record is one that is produced only at otherwise regularly scheduled intervals
 
2. The request would require data compilation, extraction, or programming to produce the record
Assistance in Identifying Requested Records
If the Superintendent or designee denies a request for disclosable records, they shall assist the requester in making a
focused and effective request that reasonably describes an identifiable record. To the extent reasonable under the
circumstances, the Superintendent or designee shall do all of the following: (Government Code 6253.1)
1. Assist in identifying records and information responsive to the request or the purpose of the request, if
specified
If after making a reasonable effort to elicit additional clarifying information from the requester to help identify
the record, the Superintendent or designee is still unable to identify the information, this requirement shall be
deemed satisfied.
 
2. Describe the information technology and physical location in which the records exist
 
3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the records or information sought
Provisions of the Public Records Act shall not be construed so as to delay access for purposes of inspecting records
open to the public. Any notification denying a request for public records shall state the name and title of each
person responsible for the denial.
