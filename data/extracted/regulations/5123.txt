and the Superintendent or designee agree that the student shall continue in kindergarten for not more than one
additional school year. (Education Code 48011)
Whenever a student continues in kindergarten for an additional year, the Superintendent or designee shall secure an
agreement, signed by the parent/guardian, stating that the student shall continue in kindergarten for not more than

academic achievement. (Education Code 48070.5)
If the teacher's recommendation to promote is contingent on the student's participation in a summer school or
interim session remediation program, the student's academic performance shall be reassessed at the end of the
remediation program, and the decision to retain or promote the student shall be reevaluated at that time. The
teacher's evaluation shall be provided to and discussed with the student's parents/guardians and the principal before
any final determination of retention or promotion. (Education Code 48070.5)
If the student does not have a single regular classroom teacher, the principal or designee shall specify the teacher(s)
responsible for the decision to promote or retain the student. (Education Code 48070.5)
When a student is identified as being at risk of retention, the Superintendent or designee shall so notify the student's
parent/guardian as early in the school year as practicable. The student's parent/guardian shall be provided an
opportunity to consult with the teacher(s) responsible for the decision to promote or retain the student. (Education
Code 48070.5)
The Superintendent or designee shall also provide a copy of the district's promotion/retention policy and
administrative regulation to those parents/guardians who have been notified that their child is at risk of retention.
The teacher's decision to promote or retain a student may be appealed consistent with Board of Education policy,
administrative regulation and law.
The burden shall be on the appealing party to show why the teacher's decision should be overruled. (Education Code
48070.5)
To appeal a teacher's decision, the appealing party parents/guardians shall submit a written request to the
Superintendent or designee specifying the reasons that the teacher's decision should be overruled. The appeal must
be initiated within 10 school days of the determination of retention or promotion.
The teacher shall be provided an opportunity to state orally and/or in writing the criteria on which his/her decision
was based.
Within 30 days of receiving the request, the Superintendent or designee shall determine whether or not to overrule
the teacher's decision. Prior to making this determination, the Superintendent or designee may meet with the
appealing party and the teacher. If the Superintendent or designee determines that the appealing party has
overwhelmingly proven that the teacher's decision should be overruled, he/she shall overrule the teacher's decision.
The Superintendent or designee's determination may be appealed by submitting a written appeal to the Board within
15 school days. Within 30 days of receipt of a written appeal, the Board shall meet in closed session to decide the
appeal. The Board's decision may be made on the basis of documentation prepared as part of the appeal process or,
at the discretion of the Board, the Board may also meet with the appealing party, the teacher and the
Superintendent/designee to decide the appeal. The decision of the Board shall be final.
If the decision of the Board is unfavorable to the appealing party, he/she shall have the right to submit a written
statement of objections which shall become part of the student's record.
