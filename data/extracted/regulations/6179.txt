Cautionary Notice 2010-13: AB 1610 (Ch. 724, Statutes of 2010) amended Education Code 37252.2 to relieve
districts from the obligation, until July 1, 2013, to perform any activities that are deemed to be reimbursable state
mandates under that section. As a result, certain provisions of the following policy or administrative regulation
that reflect those requirements may be suspended.
Supplemental instructional programs shall be offered outside the regular school day. Such programs may be offered
during the summer, before school, after school, on Saturday, and/or during intersessions. (Education Code 37252,
37252.2, 37252.8, 37253)
Priority for enrollment in supplemental instruction offered at a time other than Saturday shall be given to any student
whose parent/guardian has informed the Superintendent or designee that the student is unable to attend a Saturday
school program for religious reasons. (Education Code 37252, 37252.2, 37252.8, 37253)
Supplemental Instruction Based on Retention or Academic Deficiencies
Students in grades 2-8 who have been retained or recommended for retention shall be eligible for supplemental
instruction under the following circumstances: (Education Code 37252.2)
1. For the purposes of this program, a student shall be considered to be enrolled in a grade immediately upon
completion of the preceding grade.
 
2. Students who were enrolled in grade 6 during the prior school year shall be eligible for summer school
instruction.
To the extent that the district provides supplemental instruction to students in grades 2-6 who are identified as
being at risk of retention or as having deficiencies in mathematics, reading, or written expression, those students also
shall be subject to the provisions set forth in items #1 and #2 above. (Education Code 37252.8)
The Superintendent or designee shall seek the active involvement of parents/guardians and classroom teachers in
the development and implementation of supplemental instructional programs. (Education Code 37252.2, 37252.8)
An intensive remedial program in reading or written expression shall, as needed, include instruction in phonemic
awareness, systematic explicit phonics and decoding, word attack skills, spelling and vocabulary, explicit instruction
of reading comprehension, writing, and study skills. (Education Code 37252.2, 37252.8)
Supplemental Instruction Based on Progress Toward Passing Exit Examination
Students in grades 7-12 who do not demonstrate "sufficient progress," as defined in Board policy, toward passing the
state exit exam required for high school graduation shall be eligible for supplemental instruction under the following
circumstances: (Education Code 37252)
For purposes of this program, a student shall be considered to be enrolled in a grade immediately upon
completion of the preceding grade.
The curriculum of the supplemental instruction program shall reflect state academic content standards to the extent
that the district curriculum is aligned with those state standards, and shall be designed to assist students to succeed
on the exit exam. (Education Code 60851)
