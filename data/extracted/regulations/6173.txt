Definitions
Homeless means students who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence and includes: (Education Code 48852.7;
42 USC 11434a)
1. Students who are sharing the housing of other persons due to loss of housing, economic hardship, or a similar
reason; are living in motels, hotels, trailer parks, or camping grounds due to the lack of alternative adequate
accommodations; are living in emergency or transitional shelters; or are abandoned in hospitals.
 
2. Students who have a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily
used as regular sleeping accommodations for human beings.
 
3. Students who are living in cars, parks, public spaces, abandoned buildings, substandard housing, bus or train
stations, or similar settings.
 
4. Migratory children who qualify as homeless because the children are living in conditions described in items #1-

Unaccompanied youth includes youth not in the physical custody of a parent or guardian. (42 USC 11434a)
School of origin means the school that the student attended when permanently housed or the school in which the student was
last enrolled, including a preschool. If the school the homeless student attended when permanently housed is different from
the school in which they were last enrolled, or if there is some other school that they attended within the preceding 15
months and with which they are connected, the district liaison shall determine, in consultation with and with the agreement of
the homeless student and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the student, and in the best interests
of the homeless student, which school shall be deemed the school of origin. (Education Code 48852.7; 42 USC 11432)
Best interest means that, in making educational and school placement decisions for a homeless student, consideration is given
to, among other factors, educational stability, the opportunity to be educated in the least restrictive educational setting
necessary to achieve academic progress, and the student's access to academic resources, services, and extracurricular and
enrichment activities that are available to all district students. (Education Code 48850, 48853; 42 USC 11432)
District Liaison - The Superintendent designates the following staff person as the district liaison for homeless students:
 Director of Student Services - Antonio Perez
 750 Bradford Avenue
 Redwood City, CA 94063
 650-482-2457

The district's liaison for homeless students shall ensure that:
1. Homeless students are identified by school personnel through outreach and coordination activities with other
entities and agencies.
 
2. Homeless students are enrolled in, and have a full and equal opportunity to succeed in, district schools.
 
3. Homeless families and children and youth have access to and receive educational services for which they are
eligible, including services through Head Start and Early Head Start programs, early intervention services under
Part C of the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and other preschool programs administered by
the district.
 
4. Ensure that homeless families and students receive referrals to health care services, dental services, mental
health and substance abuse services, housing services, and other appropriate services.
 
5. Parents/guardians are informed of the educational and related opportunities available to their children and are
provided with meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children.


6. Notice of the educational rights of homeless children is disseminated in locations frequented by
parents/guardians of homeless children and youth and by unaccompanied youth, including schools, family
shelters, public libraries, and hunger relief agencies (soup kitchens). The rights shall be presented in a manner
and form understandable to the parents/guardians of homeless students and unaccompanied youth.
 
7. Enrollment disputes are mediated in accordance with law, and the section "Resolving Enrollment Disputes"
below.
 
8. Parents/guardians of homeless students and unaccompanied youth are fully informed of all transportation
services, including transportation to the school of origin, and assist them in accessing transportation to the
chosen school.
 
9. Ensure that school personnel providing services to homeless students, including principals and other school
leaders, attendance supervisors, teachers, enrollment personnel, and specialized instructional support
personnel, receive professional development and other support.
 
10. Ensure that unaccompanied youth are enrolled in school, have opportunities to meet the same challenging
state academic standards established for other students, and are informed of their status as independent
students under 20 USC 1087vv and that they may receive assistance from the district liaison to receive
verification of their independent student status for purposes of applying for federal student aid pursuant to 20
USC 1090.
 
11. Coordinate and collaborate with state coordinators and community and school personnel responsible for the
provision of education and related services to homeless students, including the provision of comprehensive
data to the state coordinator as required by law.
In addition, when notified pursuant to Education Code 48918.1, the district liaison shall assist, facilitate, or represent a
homeless student who is undergoing a disciplinary proceeding that could result in their expulsion. When notified pursuant to
Education Code 48915.5, the district liaison shall participate in an individualized education program team meeting to make a
manifestation determination regarding the behavior of a student with a disability.
The Superintendent or designee shall inform homeless children and youth, their parents/guardians, school personnel, service
providers, and advocates working with homeless families of the duties of the district's liaison. They shall also provide the
name and contact information of the district's liaison to the California Department of Education (CDE) for publishing on the
CDE's web site. (42 USC 11432)
Enrollment
Placement decisions for homeless students shall be based on the student's best interest. 
In determining a student's best interest, the district shall consider student-centered factors related to the student's best
interest, including factors related to the impact of mobility on achievement, education, health, and safety, giving priority to
the request of the student's parent/guardian or, in the case of an unaccompanied youth, the youth. (42 USC 11432)
Such factors may include, but are not limited to, the age of the student, the distance of the commute and the impact it may
have on the student’s education, personal safety issues, the student’s need for special instruction, the length of anticipated
stay in the temporary shelter or other temporary location, likely area of future housing, school placement of siblings, and the
time remaining in the school year.
However, placement decisions shall not be based on whether a homeless student lives with their homeless parent/guardian
or has been temporarily placed elsewhere.
In determining a student's best interest, a homeless student shall, to the extent feasible, be placed in their school of origin,
unless the student's parent/guardian or the unaccompanied youth requests otherwise. (Education Code 48852.7; 42 USC
11432)
In the case of an unaccompanied youth, the district’s homeless liaison shall assist in placement or enrollment decisions, give
priority to the views of the student, and provide notice to the student of their appeal rights. (42 USC 11432)
Once a placement decision has been made, the principal or designee shall immediately enroll the student in the school
selected by the district. The student shall be enrolled even if they:

1. Have outstanding fees, fines, textbooks, or other items or monies due to the school last attended.
 
2. Does not have clothing normally required by the school, such as school uniforms.
 
3. Is unable to provide records normally required for enrollment, such as previous academic records, proof of residency,
and records of immunization and other required health records.
 
4. Has missed application or enrollment deadlines during any period of homelessness.
The principal or designee shall immediately contact the school last attended by the student to obtain the relevant records. If
the student needs to obtain immunizations or does not possess immunization or other required health records, the principal
or designee shall refer the parent/guardian to the district’s liaison for homeless students. The liaison shall assist the
parent/guardian in obtaining the necessary immunizations, screenings, or records for the student. (42 USC 11432)
If the student is placed at a school other than their school of origin or the school requested by their parent/guardian or an
unaccompanied youth, the Superintendent or designee shall provide the parent/guardian or the unaccompanied youth with a
written explanation of the decision along with a statement regarding the right to appeal the placement decision. (42 USC
11432)
The written explanation shall be in a manner and form understandable to such parent/guardian or unaccompanied youth. 
At the point of any change or subsequent change in the residence of a homeless student, the student may continue attending
their school of origin for the duration of the homelessness.
To ensure that the homeless student has the benefit of matriculating with their peers in accordance with the established
feeder patterns, the following shall apply: 
1. If the student is transitioning between grade levels, they shall be allowed to continue in the same attendance
area.
 
2. If the student is transitioning to a middle school or high school, and the school designated for matriculation is in
another school district, they shall be allowed to continue to the school designated for matriculation in that
district.
If the student's status changes before the end of the school year so that they are no longer homeless, they shall be allowed to
stay in the school of origin through the duration of the school year if they are in grades K-8.
Enrollment Dispute Resolution Process
If a dispute arises over student eligibility, school selection or enrollment in a particular school, the matter shall be referred to
the district liaison who shall carry out the dispute resolution process as expeditiously as possible.
The parent/guardian or unaccompanied youth shall be provided with a written explanation of any decisions related to
eligibility, school selection, or enrollment and of the right of the parent/guardian or unaccompanied youth to appeal such
decisions. 
The written explanation shall include:
1. A description of the action proposed or refused by the district.
 
2. An explanation of why the action is proposed or refused.
 
3. A description of any other options the district considered and the reasons that any other options were rejected.
 
4. A description of any other factors relevant to the district's decision and information related to the eligibility or best
interest determination including the facts, witnesses, and evidence relied upon and their sources.
 
5. Appropriate timelines to ensure any relevant deadlines are not missed.
 
6. Contact information for the district liaison and state coordinator, and a brief description of their roles.
The written explanation shall be complete, as brief as possible, simply stated and provided in language that the
parent/guardian or student can understand. 

The district liaison may use an informal process as an alternative to formal dispute resolution procedures, provided that the
parents/guardians or unaccompanied youth have access to the more formal process if informal resolution is not successful in
resolving the matter.
In working with a student's parents/guardians or unaccompanied youth to resolve an enrollment dispute, the district liaison
shall:
1. Inform them that they may provide written and/or oral documentation to support their position.
 
2. Inform them that they may seek the assistance of social services, advocates, and/or service providers in having
the dispute resolved.
 
3. Provide them a simple form that they may use and turn in to the school to initiate the dispute resolution
process.
 
4. Provide them a copy of the dispute form they submit for their records.
 
5. Provide them the outcome of the dispute for their records.
When a student’s parent/guardian or an unaccompanied youth involved in the enrollment dispute is an English learner, Items
#1-5 shall be provided either in the native language of the parent/guardian or unaccompanied youth or through an
interpreter, and any additional support needed because of a disability of that parent/guardian or unaccompanied youth shall
be made available without a charge.
If a parent/guardian or unaccompanied youth disagrees with the liaison’s enrollment decision, they may appeal the decision to
the Superintendent. The Superintendent shall make a determination within five working days.
If the parent/guardian chooses to appeal the district’s placement decision, the district liaison shall forward all written
documentation and related paperwork to the homeless liaison at the county office of education.
Pending final resolution of the dispute, including all available appeals, the student shall be immediately enrolled in the school
in which enrollment is sought and shall be allowed to attend classes and participate fully in school activities.
Transportation
The district shall provide transportation for a homeless student to and from their school of origin when the student is residing
within the district and the parent/guardian, or the district liaison in the case of an unaccompanied youth, requests that such
transportation be provided. If the student moves outside of district boundaries, but continues to attend their school of origin
within this district, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with the superintendent of the district in which the student is
now residing to agree upon a method to apportion the responsibility and costs of the transportation. (42 USC 11432)
The district shall not be obligated to provide transportation to students who continue attending their school of origin after
they cease to be homeless, unless the formerly homeless student has an individualized education program that includes
transportation as a necessary related service for the student. (Education Code 48852.7)
Eligibility for Extracurricular Activities
A homeless student who enrolls in any district school shall be immediately deemed to meet all residency requirements for
participation in interscholastic sports or other extracurricular activities. (Education Code 48850)
Notification and Complaints
Information regarding the educational rights of homeless students, as specified in Education Code 51225.1 and 51225.2, shall

and other interested parties pursuant to 5 CCR 4622. (Education Code 51225.1, 51225.2)

specified in Education Code 51225.1 or 51225.2, may be filed in accordance with the district's procedures in AR 1312.3 -
