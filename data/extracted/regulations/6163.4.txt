Online/Internet Services: User Obligations and Responsibilities
Students are authorized to use district equipment to access the Internet or other online services in accordance with

based on their race/ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, or political
beliefs.
Harmful matter includes matter, taken as a whole, which to the average person, applying contemporary
statewide standards, appeals to the prurient interest and is matter which depicts or describes, in a patently
offensive way, sexual conduct and which lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.
(Penal Code 313)
 
4. Unless otherwise instructed by school personnel, students shall not disclose, use, or disseminate personal

individuals contacted through the Internet without the permission of their parents/guardians.
Personal information includes the student's name, address, telephone number, Social Security number, or other

utilized for research projects should be given proper credit as with any other printed source of information.
 
9. Students shall not intentionally upload, download, or create computer viruses and/or maliciously attempt to
harm or destroy district equipment or materials or manipulate the data of any other user, including so-called
"hacking."
 
10. Students shall not attempt to interfere with other users' ability to send or receive email, nor shall they attempt
to read, delete, copy, modify, or use another individual's identity.
 
11. Students shall report any security problem or misuse of the services to the teacher or principal.
The district reserves the right to monitor the system for improper use.
The principal or designee may cancel a student's user privileges whenever the student is found to have violated
Board policy, administrative regulation, or the district's Acceptable Use Agreement. Inappropriate use also may result
in disciplinary action and/or legal action in accordance with law and Board policy.
