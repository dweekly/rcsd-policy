Definitions
Average daily classroom attendance (ADA) or classroom ADA is ADA for classroom-based apportionment as used in
Education Code 47612.5. (5 CCR 11969.2)
In-district classroom ADA is classroom ADA attributable to in-district students. (5 CCR 11969.2)
In-district students are those charter school students who are entitled to attend a district school. Students eligible to
attend district schools based on an interdistrict attendance agreement or parent/guardian employment shall be
considered students of the district where they reside. (5 CCR 11969.2)
Operating in the district means the charter school is either currently providing public education to in-district students
or has identified at least 80 in-district students who are meaningfully interested in enrolling in the charter school for
the following year, regardless of whether the district is or is proposed to be the chartering entity and whether or not
the charter school has a facility inside the district's boundaries. (Education Code 47614; 5 CCR 11969.2)
Reasonably equivalent facilities are facilities that are sufficient to accommodate charter school students in conditions
reasonably equivalent to those in which the students would be accommodated if they were attending other public
schools of the district. Reasonable equivalency shall be determined based on a comparison group of district schools
with similar grade levels, the capacity of facilities, and the condition of facilities, as described below in the section
"Submission and Review of Facilities Requests." (5 CCR 11969.2, 11969.3)
Furnished and equipped means the facilities include reasonably equivalent furnishing necessary to conduct classroom
instruction and to provide for student services that directly support classroom instruction as found in the comparison
group schools established under 5 CCR 11969.3(a) and that the facilities have equipment that is reasonably
equivalent to the comparison group schools. Equipment means property that does not lose its identity when
removed from its location and is not changed materially or consumed immediately (e.g., within one year). Equipment
has relatively permanent value and its purchase increases the total value of the district's physical properties.
Examples include furniture, vehicles, machinery, motion picture film, videotape, furnishings that are not an integral
part of the building or building system, and certain intangible assets such as major software programs. Furnishings
and equipment acquired for a school site with nondistrict resources are excluded when determining reasonable
equivalence. (5 CCR 11969.2)
Contiguous facilities are those facilities contained on a school site or immediately adjacent to a school site. If the in-
district classroom ADA of the charter school cannot be accommodated on any single school site, contiguous facilities
also include facilities located at more than one site, provided that the district minimizes the number of sites assigned
and considers student safety. If none of the district-operated schools has grade levels similar to the charter school,
then a contiguous facility shall be an existing facility that is most consistent with the needs of students in the grade
levels served at the charter school. (5 CCR 11969.2, 11969.3)
Conversion charter school is a charter school established through the conversion of an existing public school.
(Education Code 47605)
Eligibility for District Facilities
A charter school shall be operating in the district, as defined above, before it submits a request for facilities. A new or
proposed charter school operating in the district is eligible to request facilities for a particular fiscal year only if it
submits its charter petition before November 1 of the fiscal year preceding the year for which facilities are
requested. A new charter school is entitled to be allocated and/or provided access to facilities only if it receives
approval of its charter petition before March 15 of the fiscal year preceding the year for which facilities are
requested. (5 CCR 11969.9)
Submission and Review of Facilities Requests
The following procedures shall apply to a charter school's request for facilities:
1. On or before November 1, a charter school shall submit a written request for facilities to the Superintendent or
designee for the next fiscal year. The request shall include: (Education Code 47614; 5 CCR 11969.2, 11969.9)
 
Board Policy Manual
Redwood City School District

a. Reasonable projections of in-district and total ADA and in-district and total classroom ADA, based on
ADA claimed for apportionment, if any, in the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the facilities
request is made, adjusted for expected changes in enrollment in the forthcoming fiscal year
Projections of in-district ADA, in-district classroom ADA, and the number of in-district students shall be
broken down by grade level and by the district school that the students would otherwise attend.
Nonclassroom ADA may be included in the ADA calculation only to the extent of instructional time that
students generating nonclassroom ADA are actually in the classroom under the direct supervision and
control of a charter school employee, and only if the district and the charter school agree upon the
time(s) that the facilities devoted to students generating nonclassroom-based ADA will be used.
 
b. A description of the methodology for the projections
 
c. If relevant (i.e., when a charter school is not yet open or to the extent an operating charter school
projects a substantial increase in ADA), documentation of the number of in-district students meaningfully
interested in attending the charter school that is sufficient for the district to determine the
reasonableness of the projection, but that need not be verifiable for precise arithmetical accuracy
 
d. The charter school's operational calendar
 
e. Information regarding the district's school site and/or general geographic area in which the charter
school wishes to locate
 
f. Information on the charter school's educational program that is relevant to assignment of facilities, if any
In submitting a facilities request, the charter school shall use a form specified by the district. The charter
school shall distribute a reasonable number of copies of the written request to parents/guardians, school
staff, and/or other interested parties, or shall otherwise make the request available for review.
 
2. On or before December 1, the district shall review the charter school's projections of in-district and total ADA
and in-district and total classroom ADA, express any objections in writing, and state the projections the district
considers reasonable. If the district does not express any objections in writing and state its own projections by
the deadline, the charter school's projections are no longer subject to challenge and the district shall base its
offer of facilities on those projections. (5 CCR 11969.9)
 
3. On or before January 2, the charter school shall respond to any objections expressed by the district and to the
district's attendance projections provided pursuant to item #2 above. The charter school shall reaffirm or
modify its previous projections as necessary to respond to the information received from the district pursuant
to item #2. If the charter school does not respond by January 2, the district's projections provided pursuant to
item #2 are no longer subject to challenge and the district shall base its offer of facilities on those projections.
(5 CCR 11969.9)
 
4. The district shall determine what facilities it will offer to the charter school, ensuring that the facilities are
reasonably equivalent to other district facilities. (5 CCR 11969.3)
If a charter school was established through the conversion of an existing public school pursuant to Education
Code 47605(a)(2), the condition of the facility previously used by the district shall be considered to be
reasonably equivalent for the first year the charter school uses the facility. (5 CCR 11969.3)
For any other charter school, reasonable equivalency shall be based on the following criteria as detailed in 5
CCR 11969.3: (5 CCR 11969.3)
 
a. A comparison group of district schools with similar grade levels
If a charter school's grade-level configuration is different from the configuration of the district's schools,
the district shall not pay for the modification of a school site to accommodate the charter school's
configuration.
 
b. Capacity, including equivalency of the ratio of teaching stations (classrooms), specialized classroom
space, and nonteaching space to ADA

c. Condition of facilities, as determined by assessing such factors as age of facilities (from last
modernization), quality of materials, and state of maintenance, including:
 
i. School site size
 
ii. Condition of interior and exterior surfaces
 
iii. Condition of mechanical, plumbing, electrical, and fire alarm systems, including conformity to
applicable codes
 
iv. Availability and condition of technology infrastructure
 
v. Condition of the facility as a safe learning environment, including, but not limited to, the suitability
of lighting, noise mitigation, and size for intended use
 
vi. Condition of the facility's furnishing and equipment
 
vii. Condition of athletic fields and/or play area space
5. On or before February 1, the district shall prepare a written preliminary proposal regarding the space to be
allocated to the charter school and/or to which the charter school is to be provided access. In evaluating and
accommodating the charter school's request, the charter school's in-district students shall be given the same
consideration as students in the district's schools, subject to the requirement that the facilities provided must
be contiguous. At a minimum, the preliminary proposal shall include: (5 CCR 11969.2, 11969.3, 11969.9)
 
a. The projections of in-district classroom ADA on which the proposal is based
 
b. The specific location(s) of the space
 
c. All conditions pertaining to the space, including a draft of any proposed agreement pertaining to the
charter school's use of the space
 
d. The projected pro rata share amount and a description of the methodology used to determine that
amount
 
e. A list and description of the comparison group schools used in developing the district's preliminary
proposal and a description of the difference between the preliminary proposal and the charter school's
request submitted pursuant to item #1 above
 
6. On or before March 1, the charter school shall respond in writing to the district's preliminary proposal made
pursuant to item #5 above and shall express any concerns, including differences between the preliminary
proposal and the charter school's request, and/or make a counter proposal. (5 CCR 11969.9)
 
7. On or before April 1, having reviewed any concerns and/or counter proposals made by the charter school
pursuant to item #6 above, the district shall submit, in writing, a final notification of the space to be offered to
the charter school. The notification shall include a response to the charter school's concerns and/or counter
proposal, if any. The final notification shall specifically identify: (5 CCR 11969.9)
a. The teaching stations, specialized classroom spaces, and nonteaching station spaces offered for the
exclusive use of the charter school and the teaching stations, specialized classroom spaces, and
nonteaching spaces to which the charter school is to be provided access on a shared basis with district-
operated programs
 
b. Arrangements for sharing any shared space
 
c. The assumptions of in-district classroom ADA for the charter school upon which the allocation is based,
and if the assumptions are different than those submitted by the charter school pursuant to item #3
above, a written explanation of the reasons for the differences
 
d. The specific location(s) of the space

e. All conditions pertaining to the space
 
f. The pro rata share amount
 
g. The payment schedule for the pro rata amount, which shall take into account the timing of revenues
from the state and from local property taxes
 
8. By May 1 or within 30 days after the district notification pursuant to item #7 above, whichever is later, the
charter school shall notify the district in writing whether or not it intends to occupy the offered space. (5 CCR
11969.9)
The charter school's notification may be withdrawn or modified before this deadline. After the deadline, if the charter
school has notified the district that it intends to occupy the offered space, the charter school is committed to paying
the pro rata share amount as identified. If the charter school does not notify the district by this deadline that it
intends to occupy the offered space, then the space shall remain available for district programs and the charter
school shall not be entitled to use facilities of the district in the following fiscal year. (5 CCR 11969.9)
Availability of Facilities
The space allocated to the charter school by the district, or the space to which the district provides the charter
school access, shall be furnished, equipped, and available for occupancy at least 10 working days prior to the first day
of instruction of the charter school. For good cause, the district may reduce the period of availability to a period of
not less than seven working days. (5 CCR 11969.9)
Space allocated for use by the charter school, subject to sharing arrangements, shall be available for the charter
school's entire school year regardless of the district's instructional year or class schedule. (5 CCR 11969.5)
For a conversion charter school, the school site identified in the school's charter shall be made available to the
charter school for its second year of operation and thereafter upon annual request for facilities from the district
pursuant to this administrative regulation. If, as a result of a material revision of the charter, either the location of the
conversion charter school is changed or the district approves the operation of additional sites by the school, then the
school may request, and the district shall provide, facilities in accordance with law, the revised charter, and this
administrative regulation. (5 CCR 11969.3)
Written Agreement Regarding Facilities Operations
The district and charter school shall negotiate an agreement regarding the use of and payment for the space which
contains, at a minimum, the information included in the district's final notification pursuant to item #7 in the section
"Submission and Review of Facilities Requests" above. (5 CCR 11969.9)
A reciprocal hold-harmless/indemnification provision shall be established between the district and the charter
school. The charter school shall maintain general liability insurance naming the district as an additional insured in
order to indemnify the district for any damage and losses. The district shall maintain first party property insurance for
the facilities allocated to the charter school. (5 CCR 11969.9)
Responsibilities for facility maintenance and improvements shall be as follows: (5 CCR 11969.4, 11969.9)
1. The district shall be responsible for:
 
a. Modifications necessary to maintain the facility in accordance with applicable building codes pursuant to
Education Code 47610 or 47610.5
 
b. Replacement of district-provided furnishings and equipment in accordance with district schedules and
practices
 
c. Projects eligible to be included in the district's deferred maintenance plan
 
2. The charter school shall be responsible for the ongoing operations and maintenance of facilities, furnishings,
and equipment.
The charter school shall not sublet or use the facilities for purposes other than those that are consistent with district
policies and practices without permission of the Superintendent or designee. (5 CCR 11969.5)

Facilities, furnishings, and equipment provided to a charter school by the district shall remain the property of the
district. (5 CCR 11969.4)
The district may charge the charter school, in accordance with 5 CCR 11969.7, for a pro rata share of the district's
facilities costs for activities related to keeping the physical plant open, comfortable, and safe for use and keeping the
grounds, buildings, and equipment in working condition. Such activities include maintaining safety in buildings, on
grounds, and in the vicinity of schools; plant maintenance and operations; facilities acquisition and construction; and
facilities rents and leases. (Education Code 47614; 5 CCR 11969.2)
The charter school shall report actual in-district and total ADA and classroom ADA to the district every time that the
charter school reports ADA for apportionment purposes. If the charter school generates less ADA than projected,
the following provisions shall apply to any overallocated space: (Education Code 47614; 5 CCR 11969.3, 11969.8,
11969.9)
1. The charter school shall reimburse the district for the overallocated space as set forth in 5 CCR 11969.8,
unless the district agrees, in response to the notification by the charter school of overallocation, to exercise its
sole discretion to use the overallocated space for district programs.
 
2. In the case of a conversion charter school, the overallocated space shall not be subject to reimbursement
under the following circumstances:
 
a. The school notifies the district, by February 1 of its first year of operation, that it will have overallocated
space in the following fiscal year. In such cases, the district may occupy all or a portion of the space
identified. A charter school that wants to recover space surrendered to the district shall apply to the
district and the district shall evaluate the application in accordance with law and this administrative
regulation.
 
b. Based on the State Board of Education's waiver of attendance area requirements in Education Code
47605(d)(1), the district makes a decision, between November 1 and June 30, to change the school's
attendance area in the forthcoming fiscal year.
Mediation of Disputes
If a dispute arises between the district and a charter school pursuant to Education Code 47614 or 5 CCR
11969.1-11969.10, both parties may agree to settle the dispute using mediation, in accordance with the following
procedures: (5 CCR 11969.10)
1. If both parties agree to mediation, the initiating party shall select a mediator, subject to the agreement of the
responding party. If the parties are unable to agree on a mediator, the initiating party shall request the CDE to
appoint a mediator within seven days to assist the parties in resolving the dispute. The mediator shall meet
with the parties as quickly as possible.
 
2. Within seven days of the selection or appointment of the mediator, the party initiating the dispute resolution
process shall send a notice to the responding party and the mediator. The notice shall include the following
information:
 
a. Name, address, and phone numbers of designated representatives of the parties
 
b. A statement of the facts of the dispute, including information regarding the parties' attempts to resolve
the dispute
 
c. The specific sections of the statute or regulations that are in dispute
 
d. The specific resolution sought by the initiating party
 
3. Within seven days of receiving the notice, the responding party shall file a written response.
 
4. The mediation shall be entirely informal in nature. Each party shall share copies of exhibits upon which its case
is based with the other party. The relevant facts shall be elicited in a narrative fashion to the extent possible,
rather than through examination and cross-examination of witnesses.
 
5. Any agreement reached by the parties shall be in writing and shall not set a precedent for any other case.

Policy Reference Disclaimer:
 
6. The mediation shall be terminated if the district and the charter school fail to meet within the specified
timelines, have not reached an agreement within 15 days from the first meeting held by the mediator, or if the
mediator declares an impasse.
 
7. The costs of the mediation shall be divided equally between the parties and paid promptly.
