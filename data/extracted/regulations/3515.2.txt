The principal or designee may direct a person to leave school grounds when there is a reasonable basis for
concluding that the person is committing, or has entered campus with the purpose of committing, an act that is likely
to interfere with the peaceful conduct, discipline, good order, or administration of school activities or with the intent
to inflict damage on any person or property. He/she may also ask a person to leave who uses loud and/or offensive
language which could provoke a violent reaction or a person who has otherwise established a continued pattern of
unauthorized entry on school grounds. This shall not apply if that person is a student, school employee, or other
person required by his employment to be on school grounds. (Education Code 44810, 44811; Penal Code 415.5,
626.7, 626.8)
The principal or designee may also direct a specified drug offender to leave school grounds, unless that person is a
student at the school, a parent/guardian of a child attending the school, or he/she has prior written permission for
entry from the principal or designee. (Penal Code 626.85)
When directing any person to leave school premises, the principal or designee shall inform the person that he/she
will be guilty of a crime if he/she:
1. Remains after being directed to leave (Education Code 44811; Penal Code 626.8)
 
2. Returns to the campus without following the school's posted registration requirements (Penal Code 626.7)
 
3. Returns within seven days after being directed to leave (Penal Code 626.8, 626.85)
The principal or designee may direct a person who is required to register as a sex offender to immediately leave
school grounds, unless he/she is on school grounds for lawful business and with the principal's permission. If such a
person does not leave school grounds, the principal or designee shall inform the person that he/she may be guilty of
a crime.
The principal or designee shall notify law enforcement as appropriate.
Appeal Procedure
Any person who is asked to leave a school building or grounds may appeal to the Superintendent or designee. This
appeal shall be made no later than the second school day after the person has departed from the school building or
grounds. After reviewing the matter with the principal or designee and the person making the appeal, the
Superintendent or designee shall render his/her decision within 24 hours after the appeal is made, and this decision
shall be binding. (Education Code 32211)
The decision of the Superintendent or designee may be appealed to the Board of Education. Such an appeal shall be
made no later than the second school day after the Superintendent or designee has rendered his/her decision. The
Board shall consider and decide the appeal at its next scheduled regular or adjourned regular public meeting. The
Board's decision shall be final. (Education Code 32211)
