The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district's campus security plan includes strategies to:
1. Secure the campus perimeter and school facilities in order to prevent criminal activity
These strategies include a risk management analysis of each campus' security system, lighting system, and
fencing. Procedures to ensure unobstructed views and eliminate blind spots caused by doorways and
landscaping shall also be considered. In addition, parking lot design may be studied, including methods to
discourage through traffic.
 
2. Secure buildings from outsiders and discourage trespassing
These strategies may include requiring visitor registration, staff and student identification tags, and patrolling
of places used for congregating and loitering.

These strategies may include plans to immediately cover graffiti as well as campus beautification projects and
shall also include students and the community in these projects.
 
4. Control access to keys and other school inventory
 
5. Detect and intervene with school crime
These strategies may include the creation of a school watch program, an anonymous crime reporting system, analysis
of school crime incidents, and collaboration with local law enforcement agencies, including providing for law
enforcement presence.
All staff shall receive training in building and grounds security procedures.
Keys
All keys used in a school shall be the responsibility of the principal or designee. Keys shall be issued only to those
employees who regularly need a key in order to carry out normal activities of their position.
The principal or designee shall create a key control system with a record of each key assigned and room(s) or
building(s) which the key opens.
Keys shall be used only by authorized employees and shall never be loaned to students. The master key shall not be
loaned.
The person issued a key shall be responsible for its safekeeping. The duplication of school keys is prohibited. If a key
