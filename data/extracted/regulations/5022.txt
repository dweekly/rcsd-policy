Surveys Requesting Information about Beliefs and Practices
A student's parent/guardian shall provide prior written consent before the student participates in a survey containing
one or more of the following items: (20 USC 1232h; Education Code 51513)
1. Political affiliations or beliefs of the student or their family
 
2. Mental or psychological problems of the student or their family
 
3. Sexual behavior or attitudes or personal beliefs and practices in family life or morality
 
4. Illegal, anti-social, self-incriminating or demeaning behavior
 
5. Critical appraisals of other individuals with whom students have close family relationships
 
6. Legally recognized privileged or analogous relationships, such as those of lawyers, physicians or ministers
 
7. Religious practices, affiliations or beliefs of the student or their parent/guardian
 
8. Income, except to the extent that income is required to be disclosed by law for participation in a program or
for receiving financial assistance under such a program
If a student participates in such a survey regarding information about personal beliefs and practices, school officials
and staff members shall not request or disclose the student's identity.
Notwithstanding the above requirements for prior written consent, the district may administer to students in grades
7-8, anonymous, voluntary, and confidential research and evaluation tools to measure student health risks and
behaviors, including tests and surveys about the student's attitudes or practices related to sex as long as
parents/guardians are provided written notice and given an opportunity to request that their child not participate.
(Education Code 51938)
If the district administers a voluntary survey that already includes questions pertaining to sexual orientation and/or
gender identity, the Superintendent or designee shall not remove such questions. (Education Code 51514)
Parent/Guardian Access to Surveys and Instructional Materials
The parent/guardian of any district student upon their request shall have the right to inspect: (20 USC 1232h;
Education Code 51938)
1. A survey or other instrument to be administered or distributed to their child that either collects personal
information for marketing or sale or requests information about beliefs and practices
 
2. Any instructional material to be used as part of their child's educational curriculum
Within a reasonable period of time of receiving a parent/guardian's request, the principal or designee shall permit the
parent/guardian to view the survey or other document they requested. A parent/guardian may view the document
any time during normal business hours.
Students whose parents/guardians exercise this option shall not be penalized by the district. (20 USC 1232h)
Health Examinations
Authorized school officials may administer to any student any physical examination or screening permitted under
California law. However, no student shall be subjected to a nonemergency, invasive physical examination without
prior written notice to their parent/guardian unless an applicable state law authorizes the student to provide consent
without parent/guardian notification. (20 USC 1232h)
