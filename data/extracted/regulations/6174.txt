Definitions
English learner means a student who is age 3-21 years, who is enrolled or is preparing to enroll in an elementary or
secondary school, and whose difficulties in speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language may be
sufficient to deny the student the ability to meet state academic standards, the ability to successfully achieve in
classrooms where the language of instruction is English, or the opportunity to participate fully in society. An English
learner may include a student who was not born in the United States or whose native language is a language other
than English; a student who is Native American or Alaska Native, or a native resident of the outlying areas, who
comes from an environment where a language other than English has had a significant impact on the individual's level
of English language proficiency; or a student who is migratory, whose native language is a language other than
English, and who comes from an environment where a language other than English is dominant. (Education Code
306; 20 USC 7801)
Designated English language development means instruction provided during a time set aside in the regular school day
for focused instruction on the state-adopted English language development standards to assist English learners to
develop critical English language skills necessary for academic content learning in English. (5 CCR 11300)
Integrated English language development means instruction in which the state-adopted English language development
standards are used in tandem with the state-adopted academic content standards. Integrated English language
development includes specially designed academic instruction in English. (5 CCR 11300)
Native speaker of English means a student who has learned and used English in their home from early childhood and
English has been their primary means of concept formation and communication. (Education Code 306)
Identification and Assessments
Each LEA must properly identify and assess all students who have a home language other than English. (EC sections
313, 60810)
At or before the time of a student's initial California enrollment, an LEA shall conduct, in writing, a home language
survey (HLS) to identify whether the primary or native language of the student is a language other than English. (5
CCR Section 11518.5[a])
If a parent or guardian HLS response indicates a primary or native language other than English, and the LEA
determines the student is eligible for initial assessment, the LEA shall promptly notify the parent or guardian, in
writing, prior to the administration of the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC) initial
assessment. (5 CCR Section 11518.5[c])
The LEA shall administer the ELPAC initial assessment to each student eligible for the initial assessment, locally
produce the official score in accordance with the directions of the test contractor, and notify the parent or guardian,
in writing, of the results of the initial assessment within 30 calendar days after the student's initial date of California
enrollment.
(EC Section 313; 5 CCR Section 11518.5[d])
Each LEA must annually assess the English language proficiency (ELP) and academic progress of each EL. A LEA shall
administer the ELPAC summative assessment during the annual summative assessment window. (EC sections 313,
60810; 5 CCR sections 11306, 11518.15[a])
When administering an initial or summative ELPAC assessment to a pupil with a disability, the LEA shall provide
designated supports or accommodations, in accordance with the pupil's individualized education plan (IEP) or Section
504 plan. When a pupil's IEP or Section 504 plan specifies that the pupil has a disability that precludes assessment
such that there are no appropriate accommodations for assessment in one or more of the listening, speaking, reading,
and writing domains, the pupil shall be assessed in the remaining domains in which it is possible to assess the pupil. 
(5 CCR Section 11518.25)
When a pupil's IEP team determines that the pupil has a significant cognitive disability such that the pupil is unable
to participate in the initial or summative assessment, or a Section of either test, even with resources, the pupil shall

be assessed as specified in the pupil's IEP.
(5 CCR Section 11518.30)
Each year after a student is identified as an English learner and until they are redesignated as English proficient, the
summative assessment of ELPAC shall be administered to the student during a four-month period after January 1 as
determined by the California Department of Education. (Education Code 313)
Administration of the ELPAC, including the use of variations and accommodations in test administration when
authorized, shall be conducted in accordance with test publisher instructions and 5 CCR 11518.5-11518.35.
The Superintendent or designee shall notify parents/guardians of their child's results on the ELPAC within 30
calendar days following receipt of the results from the test contractor or, if the results are received from the test
contractor after the last day of instruction for the school year, within 15 working days of the start of the next school
year. (Education Code 52164.1; 5 CCR 11518.15))
The parent/guardian of a student participating in, or identified for participation in, a language instruction program
supported by federal Title I or Title III funds shall receive notification of the assessment of the student's English
proficiency. Such notice shall be provided not later than 30 calendar days after the beginning of the school year or, if
the student is identified for program participation during the school year, within two weeks of the student's
placement in the program. The notice shall include all of the following: (Education Code 313.2, 440; 20 USC 6312)
1. The reason for the identification of the student as an English learner and the need for placement in a language
acquisition program

c. The manner in which the program will help the student develop their English proficiency and meet age-
appropriate academic standards for grade promotion and graduation
 
d. The specific exit requirements for the program, the expected rate of transition from the program into
classes not tailored for English learners, and the expected rate of graduation from secondary school if
applicable
 
e. Where the student has been identified for special education, the manner in which the program meets the
requirements of the student's IEP
 
4. As applicable, the identification of a student as a long-term English learner or at risk of becoming a long-term

development instruction will meet the educational strengths and needs of such students and help such
students develop English proficiency and meet age-appropriate academic standards.
 
5. Information about the parent/guardian's right to have the student immediately removed from a program upon
the parent/guardian's request
 
6. Information regarding a parent/guardian's option to decline to enroll the student in the program or to choose
another program or method of instruction, if available
 
7. Information designed to assist a parent/guardian in selecting among available programs, if more than one
program or method is offered
Language Acquisition Programs
Whenever parents/guardians of enrolled students, and those enrolled for attendance in the next school year, request

that the district establish a specific language acquisition program in accordance with Education Code 310, such
requests shall be addressed through the following process: (5 CCR 11311)
1. The school shall make a written record of each request, including any request submitted verbally, that includes
the date of the request, the names of the parent/guardian and student making the request, a general
description of the request, and the student's grade level on the date of the request. As needed, the school shall
assist the parent/guardian in clarifying the request. All requests shall be maintained for at least three years
from the date of the request.
 
2. The school shall monitor requests on a regular basis and notify the Superintendent or designee when the
parents/guardians of at least 30 students enrolled in the school, or at least 20 students in the same grade level,
request the same or a substantially similar type of language acquisition program. If the requests are for a
multilingual program model, the district shall consider requests from parents/guardians of students enrolled in
the school who are native English speakers in determining whether this threshold is reached.
Parents or legal guardians of students enrolled in the school may choose a language acquisition program that
best suits their child. "Language acquisition program" refers to educational programs designed to ensure
English acquisition as rapidly and as effectively as possible and provide instruction to students on the state-
adopted academic content standards, including the ELD standards. The language acquisition programs shall be
informed by research and must lead to grade level proficiency and academic achievement in both English and
another language. (EC sections 306[c], 310[a]; 5 CCR Section 11309[c])
Schools in which parents or legal guardians of 30 students or more per school, or the parents or legal guardians
of 20 students or more in any grade request a language acquisition program designed to provide language
instruction must be required to offer a program to the extent possible. (EC Section 310[a])
When the parents of 30 pupils or more are enrolled in a school, or when the parents of 20 pupils or more in
the same grade level are enrolled in a school, request the same or substantially similar type of a language
acquisition program, the LEA shall respond by taking actions to demonstrate the timelines and requirements in
5 CCR Section 11311[h] are met by the LEA.
In the case where the LEA determines it is not possible to implement a language acquisition program requested
by parents, the LEA shall provide in written form an explanation of the reason(s) the program cannot be
provided and may offer an alternate option that can be implemented at the school. (5 CCR Section 11311[h]
[3][B])
 
3. If the number of parents/guardians described in item #2 is attained, the Superintendent or designee shall:
 
a. Within 10 days of reaching the threshold, notify the parents/guardians of students attending the school,
the school's teachers, administrators, and the district's English learner parent advisory committee and
parent advisory committee, in writing, of the requests for a language acquisition program
 
b. Identify costs and resources necessary to implement any new language acquisition program, including,
but not limited to, certificated teachers with the appropriate authorizations, necessary instructional
materials, pertinent professional development for the proposed program, and opportunities for
parent/guardian and community engagement to support the proposed program goals
 
c. Within 60 calendar days of reaching the threshold number of parents/guardians described in item #2
above, determine whether it is possible to implement the requested language acquisition program and
provide written notice of the determination to parents/guardians of students attending the school, the
school's teachers, and administrators
 
d. If a determination is made to implement the language acquisition program, create and publish a
reasonable timeline of actions necessary to implement the program. If a determination is made that it is
not possible to implement the program, provide a written explanation of the reason(s) the program
cannot be provided
The district shall notify parents/guardians at the beginning of each school year or upon the student's enrollment
regarding the process to request a language acquisition program, including a dual-language immersion program, for
their child. The notice shall also include the following: (5 CCR 11309, 11310)
1. A description of the programs provided, including structured English immersion

2. Identification of any language to be taught in addition to English when the program includes instruction in a
language other than English
 
3. The manner in which the program is designed using evidence-based research and includes both designated and
integrated English language development
 
4. The manner in which the district has allocated sufficient resources to effectively implement the program,
including, but not limited to, certificated teachers with the appropriate authorizations, necessary instructional
materials, pertinent professional development, and opportunities for parent/guardian and community
engagement to support the program goals
 
5. The manner in which the program will, within a reasonable period of time, lead to language proficiency and
achievement of the state-adopted content standards in English and, when the program includes instruction in
another language, in that other language
 
6. The process to request establishment of a language acquisition program not offered at the school
 
7. For any dual-language immersion program offered, the specific languages to be taught. The notice also may
include the program goals, methodology used, and evidence of the proposed program's effectiveness.
Reclassification/Redesignation

1. Demonstrat English language proficiency comparable to that of the district's average native English language
speakers
 
2. Recoup any academic deficit which may have been incurred in other areas of the core curriculum as a result of
language barriers
English learners shall be reclassified as fluent English proficient when they are able to comprehend, speak, read and
write English well enough to receive instruction in an English mainstream classroom and make academic progress at
a level substantially equivalent to that of students of the same age or grade whose primary language is English and
who are in the regular course of study. (Education Code 52164.6)
The procedures used to determine whether an English learner shall be reclassified as fluent English proficient shall
include, but not be limited to: (Education Code 313, 52164.6; 5 CCR 11303)
1. Assessment of English language proficiency using an objective assessment instrument, including, but not
limited to, the ELPAC

a. Notice to parents/guardians of language reclassification and placement, including a description of the
reclassification process and the parent/guardian's opportunity to participate
b. Encouragement of parent/guardian participation in the district's reclassification procedure, including
seeking parent/guardian opinion and consultation during the reclassification process
 
4. Student performance on an objective assessment of basic skills in English that shows whether the student is
performing at or near grade level
The Superintendent or designee shall monitor the progress of reclassified students to ensure their correct
classification and placement. (5 CCR 11304)
The Superintendent or designee shall monitor students for at least two years following their reclassification to
determine whether any additional academic support is needed.
