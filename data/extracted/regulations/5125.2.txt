When school property has been willfully damaged or not returned upon demand, the principal or designee shall
inform the parent/guardian in writing of the responsible student's alleged misconduct and the reparation that may be
due.
This notice shall include a statement that the district may withhold grades, diploma or transcripts from the student
and parent/guardian until reparation is made.
If reparation is not made, the district shall afford the student his/her due process rights in conformance with
Education Code expulsion procedures and may withhold the student's grades, diploma or transcripts.
If the student and parent/guardian are unable to pay for the damages or return the property, the principal or
designee shall provide a program of voluntary work for the student to do. When this voluntary work is completed,
the student's grades, diploma or transcripts shall be released. (Education Code 48904)
When a student from whom the district is withholding grades, diploma or transcripts transfers to another district, this
information shall be sent to the new district with the student's records and a request that these items continue to be
withheld until the new district receives notification that the debt has been cleared.
The Superintendent or designee shall notify the parent/guardian in writing that this district's decision to withhold
grades, diploma or transcript will be enforced by the new district. (Education Code 48904.3)
The district shall withhold grades, diploma or transcripts from any student transferring into the district whose
misconduct caused a previous district to withhold them. When informed by the previous district that its decision has
been rescinded, the district shall release these documents. (Education Code 48904.3)
