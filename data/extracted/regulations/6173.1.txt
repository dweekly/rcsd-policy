Definitions
Foster youth means a child who has been removed from his/her home pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code
309, is the subject of a petition filed under Welfare and Institutions Code 300 or 602, or has been removed from
his/her home and is the subject of a petition filed under Welfare and Institutions Code 300 or 602 or is a nonminor
who is under the transition jurisdiction of a juvenile court, as described in Welfare and Institutions Code 450, and
satisfies the criteria specified in Education Code 42238.01. (Education Code 42238.01, 48853.5)
Person holding the right to make educational decisions means a responsible adult appointed by a court pursuant to
Welfare and Institutions Code 361 or 726.
School of origin means the school that the foster youth attended when permanently housed or the school in which
he/she was last enrolled. If the school the foster youth attended when permanently housed is different from the
school in which he/she was last enrolled, or if there is another school that the foster youth attended within the
preceding 15 months and with which the youth is connected, the district liaison for foster youth shall determine
which school is the school of origin. This determination shall be made in consultation with and with the agreement of
the foster youth and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the youth, and shall be based on
the best interests of the foster youth. (Education Code 48853.5)
Best interest means that, in making educational and school placement decisions for a foster youth, consideration is
given to, among other factors, the proximity to the school at the time of placement, appropriateness of the
educational setting, educational stability, the opportunity to be educated in the least restrictive educational setting
necessary to achieve academic progress, and the foster youth's access to academic resources, services, and
extracurricular and enrichment activities that are available to all district students. (Education Code 48850, 48853;
20 USC 6311)
District Liaison
The Superintendent designates the following position as the district's liaison for foster youth: (Education Code

district's foster youth
 
8. Monitor the educational progress of foster youth and provide reports to the Superintendent or designee and
the Board of Education based on indicators identified in the district's local control and accountability plan
The Superintendent or designee shall regularly monitor the caseload of the liaison, as well as his/her additional duties
outside of the foster youth program, to determine whether adequate time and resources are available to meet the
needs of foster youth in the district.
Enrollment
A student placed in a licensed children's institution or foster family home within the district shall attend programs
operated by the district unless one of the following circumstances applies: (Education Code 48853, 48853.5)
1. The student has an individualized education program requiring placement in a nonpublic, nonsectarian school
or agency or in another local educational agency.
 
2. The parent/guardian or other person holding the right to make educational decisions for the student
determines that it is in the best interest of the student to be placed in another education program and submits
a written statement to the district indicating that determination and that he/she is aware of the following:
 
a. The student has a right to attend a regular public school in the least restrictive environment.
 
b. The alternate education program is a special education program, if applicable.
 
c. The decision to unilaterally remove the student from the district school and to place him/her in an
alternate education program may not be financed by the district.
 
d. Any attempt to seek reimbursement for the alternate education program may be at the expense of the
parent/guardian or other person holding the right to make educational decisions for the student.
 
3. At the initial placement or any subsequent change in placement, the student exercises his/her right to continue
in his/her school of origin, as defined above.
 
a. The student may continue in the school of origin for the duration of the court's jurisdiction.

student may continue in his/her school of origin for the remainder of the school year.
 
c. If the court's jurisdiction is terminated while the student is in high school, the student may continue in
his/her school of origin until he/she graduates.
 
d. If the student is transitioning between school grade levels, he/she shall be allowed to continue in the
district of origin in the same attendance area to provide him/her the benefit of matriculating with his/her
peers in accordance with the established feeder patterns of school districts. A student who is
transitioning to a middle school or high school shall be allowed to enroll in the school designated for
matriculation in another school district.
The district liaison may, in consultation with and with the agreement of the foster youth and the person holding the
right to make educational decisions for the youth, recommend that the youth's right to attend the school of origin be
waived and he/she be enrolled in any school that students living in the attendance area in which the foster youth
resides are eligible to attend. All decisions shall be made in accordance with the foster youth's best interests. 

(Education Code 48853.5)
Prior to making any recommendation to move a foster youth from his/her school of origin, the liaison shall provide
the youth and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for the youth with a written explanation of
the basis for the recommendation and how the recommendation serves the youth's best interests. (Education Code
48853.5)
The role of the liaison shall be advisory with respect to placement decisions and determination of the school of
origin. (Education Code 48853.5)
If the liaison, in consultation with the foster youth and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for
the foster youth, agrees that the best interests of the youth would be served by his/her transfer to a school other
than the school of origin, the principal or designee of the new school shall immediately enroll the foster youth. The
foster youth shall be immediately enrolled even if he/she: (Education Code 48853.5)
1. Has outstanding fees, fines, textbooks, or other items or monies due to the school last attended
 
2. Does not have clothing normally required by the school, such as school uniforms
 
3. Is unable to produce records normally required for enrollment, such as previous academic records, proof of
residency, and medical records, including, but not limited to, immunization records or other documentation
If the foster youth or a person holding the right to make educational decisions for the foster youth disagrees with the
liaison's enrollment recommendation, he/she may appeal to the Superintendent. The Superintendent shall make a
determination within 30 calendar days of receipt of the appeal. Within 30 calendar days of receipt of the
Superintendent's decision, the parent/guardian or foster youth may appeal that decision to the Board. The Board
shall consider the issue at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The Board's decision shall be final.
If any dispute arises regarding the request of a foster youth to remain in the school of origin, the youth has the right
to remain in the school of origin pending resolution of the dispute. (Education Code 48853.5)
Transportation
The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with the local child welfare agency to determine how
transportation will be provided, arranged, and funded in a cost-effective manner to enable foster youth to remain in
their school of origin, for the duration of their time in foster care, when it is in their best interest to do so. Such
transportation costs may be paid by either the child welfare agency or the district, or shared by both. (20 USC 6312)
LEAs shall collaborate with the State or local child welfare agency to designate a point of contact within the LEA if
the corresponding child welfare agency notifies the LEA, in writing, that the child welfare agency has designated one
of its employees to serve as a point of contact for the LEA. (20 U.S.C. Section 6312[c][5][A])
An LEA shall collaborate with the State or local child welfare agency to develop and implement clear written
procedures governing how transportation to maintain children in foster care in their school of origin when in their
best interest will be provided, arranged, and funded for the duration of the time in foster care. The procedures shall
ensure the following: (20 U.S.C. Section 6312[c][5][B])
Children in foster care needing transportation to the school of origin will promptly receive transportation in a cost-
effective manner and in accordance with subsection 475(4)(A) of the Social Security Act. (42 U.S.C. Section 675[4]
[A]; 20 U.S.C. Section 6312[c][5][B][i])
If there are additional costs incurred in providing transportation to maintain children in foster care in their schools of
origin, the LEA will provide transportation to the school if any of the following agreements are in place: (20 U.S.C.
Section 6312[c][5][B][ii])
i. The local child welfare agency agrees to reimburse the LEA for the cost of such transportation; (20 U.S.C.
Section 6312[c][5][B][ii][I])
 
ii. The LEA agrees to pay for the cost of such transportation; or (20 U.S.C. Section 6312[c][5][B][ii][II])
 
iii. The LEA and the local child welfare agency agree to share the cost of such transportation. (20 U.S.C. Section
6312[c][5][B][ii][III])

Effect of Absences on Grades
The grades of a student in foster care shall not be lowered for any absence from school that is due to either of the
following circumstances: (Education Code 49069.5)
1. A decision by a court or placement agency to change the student's placement, in which case the student's
grades shall be calculated as of the date he/she left school
 
2. A verified court appearance or related court-ordered activity
Transfer of Coursework and Credits
When a foster youth transfers into a district school, the district shall accept and issue full credit for any coursework
that the foster youth has satisfactorily completed while attending another public school, a juvenile court school, or a
nonpublic, nonsectarian school or agency and shall not require the foster youth to retake the course. (Education
Code 51225.2)
If the foster youth did not complete the entire course, he/she shall be issued partial credit for the coursework
completed and shall be required to take the portion of the course that he/she did not complete at his/her previous
school. However, the district may require the foster youth to retake the portion of the course completed if, in
consultation with the holder of educational rights for the foster youth, the district finds that the foster youth is
reasonably able to complete the requirements in time to graduate from high school. Whenever partial credit is issued
to a foster youth in any particular course, he/she shall be enrolled in the same or equivalent course, if applicable, so
that he/she may continue and complete the entire course. (Education Code 51225.2)
Partial credits shall be awarded on the basis of 0.5 credits for every seven class periods attended per subject. If the
school is on a block schedule, each block schedule class period attended shall be equal to two regular class periods
per subject. Partial credits and grades earned by a student shall be included on the student's official transcript within
two business days of the district's notification of the student's transfer, as required under Education Code 49069.5.
In no event shall the district prevent a foster youth from taking or retaking a course to meet the eligibility
requirements for admission to the California State University or the University of California. (Education Code
51225.2)
Applicability of Graduation Requirements
To obtain a high school diploma, a foster youth shall complete all courses required by Education Code 51225.3 and
fulfill any additional graduation requirements prescribed by the Board.
However, when a foster youth who has completed his/her second year of high school transfers into the district from
another school district or transfers between high schools within the district, he/she shall be exempted from all
district-adopted coursework and other district-established graduation requirements, unless the district makes a
finding that the student is reasonably able to complete the additional requirements in time to graduate from high
school by the end of his/her fourth year of high school. Within 30 calendar days of the foster youth's transfer, the
Superintendent or designee shall notify the foster youth, the person holding the right to make educational decisions
for him/her, and the foster youth's social worker of the availability of the exemption and whether the foster youth
qualifies for it. If the Superintendent or designee fails to provide this notification, the student shall be eligible for the
exemption once notified, even if the notification occurs after the student is no longer a foster youth. (Education
Code 51225.1, 60851)
To determine whether a foster youth is in his/her third or fourth year of high school, the district shall use either the
number of credits the foster youth has earned as of the date of the transfer or the length of his/her school
enrollment, whichever qualifies him/her for the exemption. (Education Code 51225.1)
The Superintendent or designee shall notify any foster youth who is granted an exemption and the person holding
the right to make educational decisions for him/her how any requirements that are waived will affect the foster
youth's ability to gain admission to a postsecondary educational institution and shall provide information about
transfer opportunities available through the California Community Colleges. (Education Code 51225.1)
The district shall not require or request a foster youth to transfer schools in order to qualify for an exemption and no
request for a transfer solely to qualify for an exemption shall be made by a foster youth or any person acting on
behalf of a foster youth. (Education Code 51225.1)


If a foster youth is exempted from local graduation requirements, the exemption shall continue to apply after the
termination of the court's jurisdiction over the student while he/she is still enrolled in school or if he/she transfers to
another school or school district. (Education Code 51225.1)
Upon making a finding that a foster youth is reasonably able to complete district graduation requirements within
his/her fifth year of high school, the Superintendent or designee shall: (Education Code 51225.1)
1. Inform the foster youth and the person holding the right to make educational decisions for him/her of the
foster youth's option to remain in school for a fifth year to complete the district's graduation requirements and
how that will affect his/her ability to gain admission to a postsecondary educational institution
 
2. Provide information to the foster youth about transfer opportunities available through the California
Community Colleges
 
3. Upon agreement with the foster youth or, if he/she is under 18 years of age, the person holding the right to
make educational decisions for him/her, permit the foster youth to stay in school for a fifth year to complete
the district's graduation requirements
Eligibility for Extracurricular Activities
A foster youth whose residence changes pursuant to a court order or decision of a child welfare worker shall be
immediately deemed to meet all residency requirements for participation in interscholastic sports or other
extracurricular activities. (Education Code 48850)
Notification and Complaints
Information regarding the educational rights of foster youth shall be included in the annual uniform complaint
procedures notification distributed to students, parents/guardians, employees, and other interested parties pursuant
to 5 CCR 4622. (Education Code 48853, 48853.5, 49069.5, 51225.1, 51225.2)
Any complaint alleging that the district has not complied with requirements regarding the education of foster youth
may be filed in accordance with the district's procedures in AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures. If the
district finds merit in a complaint, the district shall provide a remedy to the affected student. A complainant not
satisfied with the district's decision may appeal the decision to the California Department of Education (CDE) and
shall receive a written decision regarding the appeal within 60 days of CDE's receipt of the appeal. If the CDE finds
merit in an appeal, the district shall provide a remedy to the affected student. (Education Code 48853, 48853.5,
49069.5, 51225.1, 51225.2)
