7. Attendance/Early Release
a. Each student admitted into a district program shall be expected to attend the full number of hours that
the program is in operation every day that they participate.
 
b. When necessary, a student's parent/guardian may request, in writing, that the Superintendent or
designee approve the reasonable late daily arrival of his/her child for the before-school program or the
reasonable early daily release of his/her child from the after-school program. The Superintendent or
designee shall not approve such a request if the student would be attending less than one-half of the

reduced-price meal to each eligible student during each program day. (Education Code 8483.76)

early release as specified in item #7 above shall apply. (Education Code 8483.76)

The Superintendent or designee may establish a registry of volunteer after-school physical recreation instructors and
other before-school and after-school program volunteers. (Education Code 35021.3)
To be included in the registry, a volunteer shall submit to a criminal background check pursuant to Education Code
45125. He/she also shall submit current contact information to the district and shall update that information
whenever the information changes. (Education Code 35021.3)
The Superintendent or designee may use a volunteer registered with the district or may select another person to
provide physical recreation to students after school hours or to provide other services. (Education Code 35021.3)
