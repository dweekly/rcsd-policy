Definitions
Bullying is an unwanted, aggressive behavior that involves a real or perceived imbalance of power between
individuals with the intent to cause emotional or physical harm. Bullying can be physical, verbal, or social/relational
and involves repetition or potential repetition of a deliberate act.
Cyberbullying includes the electronic creation or transmission of harassing communications, direct threats, or other
harmful texts, sounds, or images. Cyberbullying also includes breaking into another person's electronic account or
assuming that person's online identity in order to damage that person's reputation.
Examples of the types of conduct that may constitute bullying and are prohibited by the district include, but are not
limited to:
1. Physical bullying that inflicts harm upon a person's body or possessions, such as hitting, kicking, pinching,
spitting, tripping, pushing, taking or breaking someone's possessions, or making cruel or rude hand gestures
 
2. Verbal bullying that includes saying or writing hurtful things, such as teasing, name-calling, inappropriate sexual
comments, taunting, or threats to cause harm
 
3. Social/relational bullying that harms a person's reputation or relationships, such as leaving a person out of an
activity on purpose, influencing others not to be friends with someone, spreading rumors, or embarrassing
someone in public
 
4. Cyberbullying, such as sending demeaning or hateful text messages or emails, sending rumors by email or by
posting on social networking sites, or posting embarrassing photos, videos, web site, or fake profiles
Measures to Prevent Bullying
The Superintendent or designee shall implement measures to prevent bullying in district schools, including, but not
limited to, the following:
1. Ensuring that each school establishes clear rules for student conduct and implements strategies to promote a
positive, collaborative school climate
 
2. Providing to students, through student handbooks and other age-appropriate means, information about district
and school rules related to bullying, mechanisms available for reporting incidents or threats, and the
consequences for engaging in bullying
 
3. Encouraging students to notify school staff when they are being bullied or when they suspect that another
student is being bullied, and providing means by which students may report threats or incidents confidentially
and anonymously
 
4. Conducting an assessment of bullying incidents at each school and, if necessary, increasing supervision and
security in areas where bullying most often occurs, such as classrooms, playgrounds, hallways, restrooms, and
cafeterias
 
5. Annually notifying district employees that, pursuant to Education Code 234.1, any school staff who witnesses
an act of bullying against a student has a responsibility to immediately intervene to stop the incident when it is
safe to do so
Staff Development
The Superintendent or designee shall make the California Department of Education's online training module on the
dynamics of bullying and cyberbullying, which includes the identification of bullying and cyberbullying and the
implementation of strategies to address bullying, available annually to all certificated staff and to other employees
who have regular interaction with students. (Education Code 32283.5)


The Superintendent or designee shall provide training to teachers and other school staff to raise their awareness
about the legal obligation of the district and its employees to prevent discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and
bullying of district students. Such training shall be designed to provide staff with the skills to:
1. Discuss the diversity of the student body and school community, including their varying immigration
experiences
 
2. Discuss bullying prevention strategies with students, and teach students to recognize the behavior and
characteristics of bullying perpetrators and victims
 
3. Identify the signs of bullying or harassing behavior
 
4. Take immediate corrective action when bullying is observed
 
5. Report incidents to the appropriate authorities, including law enforcement in instances of criminal behavior
Student Instruction
As appropriate, the district shall provide students with instruction, in the classroom or other educational settings,
that promotes social-emotional learning, effective communication and conflict resolution skills, character/values
education, respect for cultural and individual differences, self-esteem development, assertiveness skills, and
appropriate online behavior. The district has developed an online Social Emotional Learning (SEL) Handbook.
The district shall also educate students about the negative impact of bullying, discrimination, intimidation, and
harassment based on actual or perceived immigration status, religious beliefs and customs, or any other individual
bias or prejudice.
Students should be taught the difference between appropriate and inappropriate behaviors, how to advocate for
themselves, how to help another student who is being bullied, and when to seek assistance from a trusted adult. As
role models for students, staff shall be expected to demonstrate effective problem-solving and anger management
skills.
To discourage cyberbullying, teachers may advise students to be cautious about sharing passwords, personal data, or
private photos online and to consider the consequences of making negative comments about others online.
Reporting and Filing of Complaints
Any student, parent/guardian, or other individual who believes that a student has been subjected to bullying or who
has witnessed bullying may report the incident to a teacher, the principal, a compliance officer, or any other available
school employee.
When a report of bullying is submitted, the principal or a district compliance officer shall inform the student or
parent/guardian of the right to file a formal written complaint in accordance with AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint
Procedures. The student who is the alleged victim of the bullying shall be given an opportunity to describe the
incident, identify witnesses who may have relevant information, and provide other evidence of bullying.
Within one business day of receiving such a report, a staff member shall notify the principal of the report, whether or
not a uniform complaint is filed. In addition, any school employee who observes an incident of bullying involving a
student shall, within one business day, report such observation to the principal or a district compliance officer,
whether or not the alleged victim files a complaint.
Within two business days of receiving a report of bullying, the principal shall notify the district compliance officer
identified in AR 1312.3.
When the circumstances involve cyberbullying, individuals with information about the activity shall be encouraged to
save and print any electronic or digital messages that they feel constitute cyberbullying and to notify a teacher, the
principal, or other employee so that the matter may be investigated. When a student uses a social networking site or
service to bully or harass another student, the Superintendent or designee may file a request with the networking
site or service to suspend the privileges of the student and to have the material removed.
Discipline/Corrective Actions


Corrective actions for a student who commits an act of bullying of any type may include counseling, behavioral
intervention and education, and, if the behavior is severe or pervasive as defined in Education Code 48900, may
include suspension or expulsion in accordance with district policies and regulations.
When appropriate based on the severity or pervasiveness of the bullying, the Superintendent or designee shall notify
the parents/guardians of victims and perpetrators and may contact law enforcement.
The Superintendent, principal, or principal's designee may refer a victim, witness, perpetrator, or other student
affected by an act of bullying to a school counselor, school psychologist, social worker, child welfare attendance
personnel, school nurse, or other school support service personnel for case management, counseling, and/or
participation in a restorative justice program as appropriate. (Education Code 48900.9)
If any student involved in bullying exhibits warning signs of suicidal thought or intention or of intent to harm another
person, the Superintendent or designee shall, as appropriate, implement district intervention protocols which may
include, but are not limited to, referral to district or community mental health services, other health professionals,
and/or law enforcement.
