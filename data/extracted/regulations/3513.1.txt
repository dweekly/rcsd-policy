The district may provide an allowance to an employee for the use of his/her personally owned cell phone or mobile
communications device for district-related business. The allowance shall be based on the business requirements of
the employee. The allowance shall be given to the employee, who shall be responsible for payments to the service
provider.
The district may purchase cell phones or other mobile communications devices for use by employees for district-
related business.
Employees who are not provided an allowance or district-owned mobile communications devices may be reimbursed
for the actual expenses of business-related calls made on their personally owned equipment, in accordance with the
district's expense reimbursement procedures.
The Superintendent or designee shall determine if an employee requires a cell phone or other mobile
communications device for the efficient performance of his/her job responsibilities. Factors that will be considered
include, but are not limited to, whether the employee's job responsibilities require:
1. A need to communicate frequently and access to a district telephone is not readily available
 
2. A need to communicate immediately to ensure the safety of district staff and students, or the security of
district property
 
3. A need to be accessible due to frequent travel or work outside of the office
The Superintendent or designee shall develop a uniform system for identifying employee cell phone or mobile
communications device needs and the most cost effective method of providing necessary equipment to employees.
He/she shall also develop a system for monitoring employee use and reimbursement of costs.
If an employee misuses the cell phone or other mobile communications device or leaves district employment, he/she
shall be responsible for fees or charges associated with cancellation of the service contract.
If the Superintendent or designee determines that an employee no longer needs a cell phone or other mobile
communications device to perform his/her job responsibilities, any fees or charges associated with cancellation of
the service contract shall be the responsibility of the district.
Documentation of Records for Tax Purposes
Documentation of personal use and district auditing of records
When an employee receives a monthly allowance for the use of his/her personally owned cell phone or mobile
communications device or has been provided the use of a district-owned device, he/she shall identify the personal
calls on the monthly bill and shall reimburse the district for the cost of the personal calls. (26 CFR 1.132-5)
In order to satisfy Internal Revenue Service documentation and substantiation requirements regarding taxable
income, the Superintendent or designee shall establish a system which requires the employee to maintain
documentation distinguishing personal and business charges as well as a system for the district to audit the
employee's bills to confirm proper business usage.
