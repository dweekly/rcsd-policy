Eligibility and Enrollment
Children eligible for the district's preschool program include those who will have their third, fourth or fifth birthday
between September 2 and December 2 of the fiscal year that they are being served. (Education Code 8208, 8235,
8236)
When a child is eligible for both the preschool program and the district's transitional kindergarten program, the family
may choose the most appropriate program for the child. In accordance with the enrollment priorities described
below, the child may be enrolled in both programs provided that the child is not enrolled in both programs for the
same time period on the same day.
Eligibility for subsidized preschool shall be as follows:
1. Children shall be eligible for subsidized preschool services if their family is a current aid recipient, income
eligible, or homeless and/or the family's children are recipients of protective services or have been identified as
being, or at risk of being, abused, neglected, or exploited. (Education Code 8235, 8263, 8263.1; 5 CCR 18131,
18134)
 
2. Children shall be eligible for subsidized wraparound preschool and child care services if their family meets at
least one of the criteria specified in item #1 above or needs child care services due to either of the following
circumstances: (Education Code 8239, 8263)
 
a. The child is identified by a legal, medical, or social services agency or emergency shelter as a recipient of
protective services or as being, or at risk of being, neglected, abused, or exploited.
 
b. The parents/guardians are engaged in vocational training leading directly to a recognized trade,
paraprofession, or profession; are employed or seeking employment; are seeking permanent housing for
family stability; or are incapacitated.
The Superintendent or designee shall consult the county's centralized eligibility list, when available, or shall maintain
a district waiting list in accordance with admission priorities. As vacancies occur, applicants shall be contacted in
order of their priority. (5 CCR 18106)
First priority for enrollment in a preschool program shall be given to neglected or abused children or foster children
age 3 or 4 years who are recipients of child protective services or who, based upon written referral from a legal,
medical, or social service agency, are at risk of being neglected, abused, or exploited. If unable to enroll a child in this
category, the district shall refer the child's parent/guardian to local resource and referral services so that services for
the child can be located. (Education Code 8236; 5 CCR 18131)
After all children with first priority are enrolled, the district shall give second priority to eligible children age 4 years
who are not enrolled in a transitional kindergarten program prior to enrolling eligible children age 3 years. (Education
Code 8236)
After enrolling all eligible children who meet the criteria for subsidized services, up to 10 percent of the program's
enrollment, calculated throughout the entire contract, may be filled with children who exceed the age limitations and
children whose family income is no more than 15 percent above the income eligibility threshold. (Education Code
8235; 5 CCR 18133)
The district may certify eligibility and enrollment up to 120 calendar days prior to the first day of the beginning of the

preschool year. After establishing eligibility at the time of initial enrollment, a child shall remain eligible for the
remainder of the program year. (Education Code 8237; 5 CCR 18082)
The district's decision to approve or deny a child's enrollment shall be communicated to the family through a written
Notice of Action mailed or delivered within 30 days from the date the application is signed by the parent/guardian. (5
CCR 18094, 18095, 18118)
Subsequently, the Superintendent or designee shall mail or deliver a Notice of Action to a parent/guardian at least 14
calendar days before any intended change in services, including, but not limited to, an increase or decrease in fees, an
increase or decrease in the amount of services, or termination of services, due to any of the following circumstances:
(5 CCR 18095, 18119)
1. A determination during recertification or update of the application that the need or eligibility requirements are
no longer being met or the fee or amount of service needs to be modified
 
2. Failure of the parent/guardian to document the family's need or eligibility after the district requested such
documentation in writing
 
3. An indication by the parent/guardian that he/she no longer wants the service
 
4. The death of a parent/guardian or child
 
5. The conclusion of a limited-term agreement, provided that the parent/guardian has been informed in writing of
the date that the services would terminate
For each child enrolled in the district's preschool program, the Superintendent or designee shall maintain a family
data file containing a completed and signed application for services, documentation of income eligibility, and a copy
of all Notices of Action. For each child not receiving subsidized services, the family data file shall also include records
of the specific reason(s) for enrolling each child, the child's family income, and evidence that the district has made a
diligent search for children eligible for subsidized services. (5 CCR 18130, 18133, 18081, 18084)
Fees and Charges
Fees for participation in the district's preschool program shall be assessed and collected in accordance with the fee
schedule established by the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (Education Code 8273, 8273.2; 5 CCR 18078)
However, no fee shall be charged to an income-eligible family whose child is enrolled in a part-day preschool
program, a family that is receiving CalWORKs cash aid, or a family that is otherwise exempted pursuant to Education
Code 8273.1. (Education Code 8273.1; 5 CCR 18110)
In addition, any family qualifying for subsidized preschool on the basis of having a child who is a recipient of child
protective services, or having a certification by a county child welfare agency that services continue to be necessary,
may be exempt from these fees for up to 12 months. Any family whose child is receiving subsidized preschool on the
basis of being at risk of abuse, neglect, or exploitation may be exempt from these fees for up to three months, unless
the family becomes eligible based on receipt of child protective services or certification of need by a county child
welfare agency. The cumulative period of exemption for these purposes shall not to exceed 24 months with written
support from the family's social services worker. (Education Code 8273.1)
The Superintendent or designee shall establish a process which involves parents/guardians in determining whether
to require parents/guardians to provide diapers. This process shall also be used to determine whether and how much
to charge parents/guardians for field trip expenses, within the limit specified in law. A child shall not be denied
participation in a field trip due to the parent/guardian's inability or refusal to pay the fee, and no adverse action shall
be taken against a parent/guardian for that inability or refusal. (Education Code 8273.3)
Disenrollment
When necessary due to a reduction in state reimbursements, families shall be disenrolled in the following order:
(Education Code 8236, 8263.3)
1. Children age 3 years whose families have the highest income in relation to family size shall be disenrolled first,
followed by children age 4 years whose families have the highest income in relation to family size.
At each age level, if two or more families have the same income ranking, the child with disabilities shall be


disenrolled last. If there are no families that have a child with disabilities, the child who has received services
the longest shall be disenrolled first.
 
2. Families of children age 3 or 4 years who are receiving child protective services or who have been documented
to be at risk of being neglected, abused, or exploited, regardless of income, shall be disenrolled last.
