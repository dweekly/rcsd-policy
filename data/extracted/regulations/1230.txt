A school-connected organization's request for authorization to operate within the district or at a district school shall contain,
as appropriate:
1. The name and purpose of the organization
 
2. The date of application
 
3. Bylaws, rules, and procedures under which the organization will operate, including procedures for maintaining the
organization's finances, membership qualifications, if any, and an agreement that the group will not engage in unlawful
discrimination
 
4. The names, addresses, and phone numbers of all officers
 
5. A list of specific objectives
 
6. An agreement to grant the district the right to audit the group's financial records, either by district personnel or a
certified public accountant, whenever any concern is raised regarding the use of the funds
 
7. The name of the bank where the organization's account will be located and the names of those authorized to withdraw
funds
 
8. The signature of the principal of the supporting school
 
9. Planned use for any money remaining at the end of the year if the organization is not continued or authorized to
continue in the future
 
10. An agreement to provide evidence of liability and/or directors and officers insurance when and in the manner required
by law
Requests for subsequent authorization shall be annually submitted to the Superintendent or designee, along with a financial
statement showing all income and expenditures from fundraisers. If the Superintendent or designee proposes to deny the
request for reauthorization, he/she shall present his/her recommendation to the Governing Board for approval.
When deemed necessary by the Board or the Superintendent or designee, the authorization for a school-connected
organization to conduct activities in the district may be revoked at any time.
Each school-connected organization shall abide by the following rules:
1. The organization shall not act as an agent of the district or school.
 
2. The organization shall not use the district's tax-exempt status and identification number. It shall be responsible
for its own tax status, accounting, internal controls, financial reporting, retention of records, and other
operations.
 
3. The organization shall use a separate name and logo. Any use of a name or logo affiliated with the district, a
district school, or a school team shall require the prior consent of the Superintendent or designee.
 
4. Funds of the school-connected organization shall not be co-mingled with district funds, including associated
student body funds.
 
5. The organization shall not hire or directly pay any district employee. If a school-connected organization wishes
to pay for additional and/or extracurricular services, the person to provide the services shall be hired through
the district's personnel department, provided the Board approves the position. At their discretion, employees
may volunteer to perform activities for school-connected organizations during nonworking hours.
These references are not intended to be part of the policy itself, nor do they indicate the basis or authority
for the Governing Board to enact this policy. Instead, they are provided as additional resources for those interested in the subject matter
