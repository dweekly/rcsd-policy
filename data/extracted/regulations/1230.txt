Requests for subsequent authorization shall be annually submitted to the Superintendent or designee, along with a financial
statement showing all income and expenditures from fundraisers. If the Superintendent or designee proposes to deny the
request for reauthorization, he/she shall present his/her recommendation to the Governing Board for approval.
When deemed necessary by the Board or the Superintendent or designee, the authorization for a school-connected
organization to conduct activities in the district may be revoked at any time.
Each school-connected organization shall abide by the following rules:
1. The organization shall not act as an agent of the district or school.
 
2. The organization shall not use the district's tax-exempt status and identification number. It shall be responsible
for its own tax status, accounting, internal controls, financial reporting, retention of records, and other
operations.

district school, or a school team shall require the prior consent of the Superintendent or designee.
 
4. Funds of the school-connected organization shall not be co-mingled with district funds, including associated
student body funds.
 
5. The organization shall not hire or directly pay any district employee. If a school-connected organization wishes
to pay for additional and/or extracurricular services, the person to provide the services shall be hired through
the district's personnel department, provided the Board approves the position. At their discretion, employees
may volunteer to perform activities for school-connected organizations during nonworking hours.
