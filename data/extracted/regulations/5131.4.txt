regardless of any parent/guardian approval of the absence.
Extension of Class Period and/or Dismissal of School
During any disturbance in which additional students might become involved while changing classes, the principal or
designee may notify all staff that any class currently in session will be extended until further notice. Upon receiving
this notification, staff shall ensure that all students in their charge remain in one location under their supervision and
shall ask all students who are in the halls to return to their classes immediately.
The principal may also request that the Superintendent dismiss school in accordance with the school disturbance
response plan.
