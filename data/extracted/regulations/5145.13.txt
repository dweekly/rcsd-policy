Responding to Requests for Information
Unless authorized by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act pursuant to 20 USC 1232g, student information
shall not be disclosed to immigration law enforcement authorities without parental consent, a court order, or judicial
subpoena. The Superintendent or designee shall annually notify parents/guardians that the district will not release
student information to third parties for immigration enforcement purposes, unless the parent/guardian consents or
as required to do so by a court order or judicial subpoena.
Upon receiving any verbal or written request for information related to a student's or family's immigration or
citizenship status, district staff shall:
1. Notify the Superintendent or designee about the information request.
 
2. Provide students and families with appropriate notice and a description of the immigration officer's request.
 
3. Document any request for information by immigration authorities.
 
4. Provide students and parents/guardians with any documents provided by the immigration enforcement officer,
unless such disclosure is prohibited by a subpoena served on the district or in cases involving investigations of
child abuse, neglect, or dependency.
Resources and data collected by the district shall not be used, directly or by others, to compile a list, registry, or
database of individuals based on national origin, immigration status, religion, or other category of individual
characteristics protected against unlawful discrimination. (Government Code 8310.3)
Responding to Requests for Access to Students or School Grounds
District staff shall receive parent/guardian consent before a student is interviewed or searched by any officer
seeking to enforce civil immigration laws at the school, unless the officer presents a valid, effective warrant signed by
a judge or a valid, effective court order. A student's parent/guardian shall be immediately notified if a law
enforcement officer requests or gains access to the student for immigration enforcement purposes, unless the
judicial warrant or subpoena restricts disclosure to the parent/guardian.
All visitors and outsiders, including immigration enforcement officers, shall register with the principal or designee
upon entering school grounds during school hours. Each visitor or outsider shall provide the principal or designee
with their name, address, occupation, age if less than 21, purpose in entering school grounds, proof of identity, and
any other information required by law. (Penal Code 627.2, 627.3)
District staff shall report the presence of any immigration enforcement officers to on-site district police and other
appropriate administrators.
As early as possible, district staff shall notify the Superintendent or designee of any request by an immigration
enforcement officer for access to the school or a student or for review of school documents, including service of
lawful subpoenas, petitions, complaints, warrants, or other such documents.
In addition, district staff shall take the following actions in response to an officer present on the school campus
specifically for immigration enforcement purposes:
1. Advise the officer that before school personnel can respond to the officer's request, they must first receive
notification and direction from the Superintendent or designee, except under exigent circumstances that
necessitate immediate action.
 
2. Request to see the officer's credentials, including their name and badge number, and the phone number of the
officer's supervisor, and note or make a copy of all such information.
 
3. Ask the officer for their reason for being on school grounds and document the response.
 
4. Request that the officer produce any documentation that authorizes their school access.
 


5. Make a copy of all documents produced by the officer and retain one copy for school records.
 
6. If the officer declares that exigent circumstances exist and demands immediate access to the campus, comply
with the officer's orders and immediately contact the Superintendent or designee.
 
7. If the officer does not declare that exigent circumstances exist, respond according to the requirements of the
officer's documentation, as follows:
 
a. If the officer has an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) administrative warrant, district staff
shall inform the agent that they cannot consent to any request without first consulting with the district's
legal counsel or other designated district official.
 
b. If the officer has a federal judicial warrant, such as a search and seizure warrant or an arrest warrant
signed by a federal judge or magistrate, district staff shall promptly comply with the warrant. If feasible,
district staff shall consult with the district's legal counsel or designated administrator before providing
the officer with access to the person or materials specified in the warrant.
 
c. If the officer has a subpoena for production of documents or other evidence, district staff shall inform
the district's legal counsel or other designated official of the subpoena and await further instructions as
to how to proceed.
 
8. Do not attempt to physically impede the officer, even if the officer appears to be exceeding the authorization
given under a warrant or other document. If an officer enters the premises without consent, district staff shall
document the officer's actions while on campus.
 
9. After the encounter with the officer, promptly make written notes of all interactions with the officer, including:
 
a. A list or copy of the officer's credentials and contact information.
 
b. The identity of all school personnel who communicated with the officer.
 
c. Details of the officer's request.
 
d. Whether the officer presented a warrant or subpoena to accompany their request, what was requested
in the warrant or subpoena, and whether the warrant or subpoena was signed by a judge.
 
e. District staff's response to the officer's request.
 
f. Any further action taken by the officer.
 
g. A photo or copy of any documents presented by the officer.
 
10. Provide a copy of these notes and associated documents collected from the officer to the district's legal
counsel or other designated district official.
The district's legal counsel or other designated official shall submit a timely report to the Board of Education
regarding the officer's requests and actions and the district's responses. (Education Code 234.7)
The Superintendent or designee shall also email the Bureau of Children's Justice in the California Department of
Justice (BCJ@doj.ca.gov) regarding any attempt by a law enforcement officer to access a school site or a student for
immigration enforcement purposes.
Responding to the Detention or Deportation of Student's Family Member
The Superintendent or designee shall encourage students and their families to update their emergency contact
information as needed throughout the school year and to provide alternative contacts, including an identified trusted
adult guardian, in case a student's parent/guardian is detained or is otherwise unavailable. The Superintendent or
designee shall notify students' families that information provided on the emergency cards will only be used in
response to specific emergency situations and not for any other purpose.
The Superintendent or designee shall also encourage all students and families to learn their emergency phone
numbers and be aware of the location of important documentation, including birth certificates, passports, social


security cards, physicians' contact information, medication lists, lists of allergies, and other such information that
would allow the students and families to be prepared in the event that a family member is detained or deported.
In the event that a student's parent/guardian is detained or deported by federal immigration authorities, the
Superintendent or designee shall release the student to the person(s) designated in the student's emergency contact
information or to any individual who presents a caregiver's authorization affidavit on behalf of the student. The
Superintendent or designee shall only contact child protective services if district personnel are unable to arrange for
the timely care of the student by the person(s) designated in the emergency contact information maintained by the
school or identified on a caregiver's authorization affidavit.
The Superintendent or designee shall notify a student whose parent/guardian was detained or deported that the
student continues to meet the residency requirements for attendance in a district school, provided that the
parent/guardian was a resident of California and the student lived in California immediately before they moved out
of state as a result of the parent/guardian's departure. (Education Code 48204.4)
The Superintendent or designee may refer a student or their family members to other resources for assistance,
including, but not limited to, an ICE detainee locator, legal assistance, or the consulate or embassy of the
parent/guardian's country of origin.
