Procedures for Verifying Subject Matter Knowledge
With the involvement of appropriate subject matter specialists, the Superintendent or designee shall develop and
employ procedures for verifying the subject matter knowledge of teachers assigned to teach in departmentalized
classes outside their credential authorization pursuant to Education Code 44258.3. For the purposes of these
procedures, subject matter specialists are curriculum specialists, resource teachers, classroom teachers certified to
teach a subject, staff to regional subject matter projects or curriculum institutes, or college faculty. (Education Code
44258.3)
Procedures to be used for this purpose shall specify: (Education Code 44258.3)
1. One or more of the following ways in which subject matter competence shall be assessed:
 
a. Observation by subject matter specialists
 
b. Oral interviews
 
c. Demonstration lessons
 
d. Presentation of curricular portfolios
 
e. Written examinations
 
2. Specific criteria and standards for verifying subject matter knowledge by any of the above methods. These
criteria shall include, but need not be limited to, evidence of the individual's knowledge of the subject matter to
be taught, including demonstrated knowledge of the curriculum framework for the subject and the specific
content of the district's course of study for the subject at the grade level to be taught.
Whenever a teacher is assigned to teach departmentalized classes pursuant to Education Code 44258.3, the
Superintendent or designee shall notify the exclusive representative of the district's certificated employees.
(Education Code 44258.3)
Verification of the subject matter competence of teachers assigned to core academic subjects in Title I and non-Title
I programs shall be based on procedures and criteria specified in 5 CCR 6100-6115.
