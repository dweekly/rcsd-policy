================================================================================

The possibility of suicide and suicidal ideation requires vigilant attention from our school staff. As a result, we are
ethically and legally responsible for providing an appropriate and timely response in preventing suicidal ideation,
attempts, and deaths. We also must work to create a safe and nurturing campus that minimizes suicidal ideation in
students.
Recognizing that it is the duty of the district and schools to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its students, this
policy aims to safeguard students and staff against suicide attempts, deaths and other trauma associated with
suicide, including ensuring adequate supports for students, staff, and families affected by suicide attempts and loss.
As it is known that the emotional wellness of students greatly impacts school attendance and educational success,
this policy shall be paired with other policies that support the emotional and behavioral wellness of students.
Student identification cards shall include the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline telephone number and may also
include the Crisis Text Line and/or a local suicide prevention hotline telephone number. (Education Code 215.5)
Staff Development
Suicide prevention training shall be provided to teachers, counselors, and other district employees who interact with
students. The training shall be offered under the direction of a district counselor/psychologist and/or in cooperation
with one or more community mental health agencies. Training shall be provided for all school staff members and
other adults on campus (including substitutes and intermittent staff, volunteers, interns, tutors, coaches, and
expanded learning [afterschool] staff).
Materials for training shall include how to identify appropriate mental health services at the school site and within
the community, and when and how to refer youth and their families to those services. Materials also may include
programs that can be completed through self-review of suitable suicide prevention materials. (Education Code 215) 
Messaging about suicide has an effect on suicidal thinking and behaviors. Consequently, Redwood City School
District along with its partners has critically reviewed and will continue to review all materials and resources used in
awareness efforts to ensure they align with best practices for safe messaging about suicide.
Staff development shall include research and information related to the following topics:
1. The higher risk of suicide among certain groups, including, but not limited to, students who are bereaved by
suicide; students with disabilities, mental illness, or substance use disorders; students who are experiencing
homelessness or who are in out-of-home settings such as foster care; and students who are lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender, or questioning youth
 
2. Individual risk factors such as previous suicide attempt(s) or self-harm, history of depression or mental illness,
family history of suicide or violence, feelings of isolation, interpersonal conflicts, a recent severe stressor or
loss, family instability, impulsivity, and other factors
 
3. Warning signs that may indicate depression, emotional distress, or suicidal intentions, such as changes in
students' personality or behavior and verbalizations of hopelessness or suicidal intent
 
4. Protective factors that may help to decrease a student's suicide risk, such as resiliency, problem-solving ability,
access to mental health care, and positive connections to family, peers, school, and community
 
5. Instructional strategies for teaching the suicide prevention curriculum and promoting mental and emotional
health
 
6. School and community resources and services, including resources and services that meet the specific needs of
high-risk groups
 
7. Appropriate ways to interact with a student who is demonstrating emotional distress or is suicidal and
procedures for intervening when a student attempts, threatens, or discloses the desire to die by suicide,
including, but not limited to, appropriate protocols for monitoring the student while the immediate referral of
the student to medical or mental health services is being processed
 


8. District procedures for responding after a suicide has occurred
Instruction
The district's comprehensive health education program shall promote the healthy students mental, emotional, and
social development of students and shall be aligned with the state content standards and curriculum framework.
Suicide prevention instruction shall be incorporated into the health education curriculum at grade 7 and grade 8 and
shall be designed to help students:
1. Identify and analyze signs of depression and self-destructive behaviors and understand how feelings of
depression, loss, isolation, inadequacy, and anxiety can lead to thoughts of suicide.
 
2. Develop coping and resiliency skills and self-esteem.
 
3. Learn to listen, be honest, share feelings, and get help when communicating with friends who show signs of
suicidal intent.
 
4. Identify trusted adults, school resources, and/or community crisis intervention resources where youth can get
help and recognize that there is no stigma associated with seeking services for mental health, substance abuse,
and/or suicide prevention.
Intervention
Students shall be encouraged to notify a teacher, principal, counselor, or other adult when they are experiencing
thoughts of suicide or when they suspect or have knowledge of another student's suicidal intentions.
Every statement regarding suicidal intent shall be taken seriously. Whenever a staff member suspects or has
knowledge of a student's suicidal intentions based on the student's verbalizations or act of self-harm, the staff
member shall promptly notify the principal or school counselor, who shall implement district intervention protocols
as appropriate.
Although any personal information that a student discloses to a school counselor shall generally not be revealed,
released, referenced, or discussed with third parties, the counselor may report to the principal or student's
parents/guardians when there is reasonable cause to believe that disclosure is necessary to avert a clear and present
danger to the health, safety, or welfare of the student or others within the school community. In addition, the
counselor may disclose information of a personal nature to psychotherapists, other health care providers, or the
school nurse for the sole purpose of referring the student for treatment. (Education Code 49602)
School employees shall act only within the authorization and scope of their credential or license. An employee is not
authorized to diagnose or treat mental illness unless specifically licensed and employed to do so. (Education Code
215)
Whenever schools establish a peer counseling system to provide support for students, peer counselors shall receive
training that includes identification of the warning signs of suicidal behavior and referral of a suicidal student to
appropriate adults.
When a suicide attempt or threat is reported, the principal or designee shall ensure student safety by taking the
following actions:
1. Immediately securing medical treatment and/or mental health services as necessary
 
2. Notifying law enforcement and/or other emergency assistance if a suicidal act is being actively threatened
 
3. Keeping the student under continuous adult supervision until the parent/guardian and/or appropriate support
agent or agency can be contacted and has the opportunity to intervene
 
4. Removing other students from the immediate area as soon as possible
The principal or designee shall document the incident in writing, including the steps that the school took in response
to the suicide attempt or threat.
The Superintendent or designee shall follow up with the parent/guardian and student in a timely manner to provide

referrals to appropriate services as needed. If the parent/guardian does not access treatment for the student, the
Superintendent or designee may meet with the parent/guardian to identify barriers to treatment and assist the family
in providing follow-up care for the student. If follow-up care is still not provided, the Superintendent or designee
shall consider whether it is necessary, pursuant to laws for mandated reporters of child neglect, to refer the matter
to the local child protective services agency.
For any student returning to school after a mental health crisis, the principal or designee and/or school counselor
may meet with the parents/guardians and, if appropriate, with the student to discuss re-entry and appropriate next
steps to ensure the student's readiness for return to school and determine the need for ongoing support.
Postvention
In the event that a student dies by suicide, the Superintendent or designee shall communicate with the student's
parents/guardians to offer condolences, assistance, and resources. In accordance with the laws governing
confidentiality of student record information, the Superintendent or designee shall consult with the
parents/guardians regarding facts that may be divulged to other students, parents/guardians, and staff.
The Superintendent or designee shall implement procedures to address students' and staff's grief and to minimize the
risk of imitative suicide or suicide contagion. The Superintendent or designee shall provide students,
parents/guardians, and staff with information, counseling, and/or referrals to community agencies as needed. School
staff may receive assistance from school counselors or other mental health professionals in determining how best to
discuss the suicide or attempted suicide with students.
Any response to media inquiries shall be handled by the district-designated spokesperson who shall not divulge
confidential information. The district's response shall not sensationalize suicide and shall focus on the district's
postvention plan and available resources.
After any suicide or attempted suicide by a student, the Superintendent or designee shall provide an opportunity for
all staff who responded to the incident to debrief, evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies used, and make
recommendations for future actions.
In support of the efforts to reduce youth suicide, and to help Districts prevent and respond to youth suicide, the San
Mateo County Office of Education (SMCOE) and San Mateo County Health System created the San Mateo County
Schools Suicide Prevention Toolkit. The toolkit was developed through an extensive collaborative process involving
community stakeholders, school mental health professionals, and suicide prevention experts including staff from
County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services (BHRS). It outlines guidelines for identifying, intervening, and
responding to suicidal and self-injurious students. It also offers best practices to school site crisis teams to be used in
the aftermath of a student death by suicide.
The toolkit is divided into three sections:
The first section provides guidelines regarding the training and education of staff, formation of a crisis response
team, signs of students at risk for suicide, student risk assessments, and responses to student self-injury,
hospitalization, and suicide.
The second section provides important forms, including forms for use by mental health professionals and members of
the school site crisis response team and/or administration to evaluate, respond to, and document a suicide risk
assessment; as well as forms documenting the release of a student to parents for psychiatric assessments and
materials to provide to students and parents in the event of a suicide.
The final section of the toolkit contains the Return to School Information Packet that will help staff work with
students and parents as a student transitions back to school after a suicide attempt or psychiatric hospitalization.
To ensure the policies regarding suicide prevention are properly adopted, implemented, and updated, the district
shall appoint an individual (or team) to serve as the suicide prevention point of contact for the district. In addition,
each school shall identify at least one staff member to serve as the liaison to the district's suicide prevention point of
contact, and coordinate and implement suicide prevention activities on their specific campus. This policy shall be
reviewed and revised as indicated, at least annually in conjunction with the previously mentioned community
stakeholders.
To the extent possible, parents/guardians/caregivers should be included in all suicide prevention efforts. At a


minimum, schools shall share with parents/guardians/caregivers the Redwood City School District suicide prevention
policy and procedures.
This suicide prevention policy shall be prominently displayed on the Redwood City School District Web page and
included in the parent handbook.
Parents/guardians/caregivers should be invited to provide input on the development and implementation of this
policy.
All parents/guardians/caregivers should have access to suicide prevention training that addresses the following:
Suicide risk factors, warning signs, and protective factors;
How to talk with a student about thoughts of suicide;
How to respond appropriately to the student who has suicidal thoughts. Such responses shall include constant
supervision of any student judged to be at risk for suicide and referral for an immediate suicide risk assessment.
