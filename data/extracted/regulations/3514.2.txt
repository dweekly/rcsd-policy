Definition
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) means a strategy that focuses on long-term prevention or suppression of pest
problems through a combination of techniques such as monitoring for pest presence and establishing treatment
threshold levels, using nonchemical practices to make the habitat less conducive to pest development, improving
sanitation, and employing mechanical and physical controls. Pesticides that pose the least possible hazard and are
effective in a manner that minimizes risks to people, property, and the environment are used only after careful
monitoring indicates they are needed according to pre-established guidelines and treatment thresholds. (Food and
Agricultural Code 13181)
Procedures
The Superintendent or designee shall designate a staff person to develop, implement, and coordinate an IPM
program that incorporates effective, least toxic pest management practices. The district's program shall include the
following elements:
1. Carefully monitoring and identifying the pest population levels and identifying practices that could affect pest
populations. Strategies for managing the pest shall be influenced by the pest species and whether that species
poses a threat to people, property, or the environment.
 
2. Setting action threshold levels to determine when pest populations or vegetation at a specific location might
cause unacceptable health or economic hazard that would indicate corrective action should be taken.
 
3. Modifying or eliminating pest habitats to deter pest populations and minimize pest infestations.
 
4. Considering a full range of possible alternative treatments. Such alternative treatments may include taking no
action or controlling the pest by physical, horticultural, or biological methods. Cost or staffing considerations
alone will not be adequate justification for use of chemical control agents.
 
5. Selecting nonchemical pest management methods over chemical methods whenever such methods are
effective in providing the desired control or, when it is determined that chemical methods must be used, giving
preference to those chemicals that pose the least hazard to people and the environment.
 
6. Ensuring that persons applying pesticides follow label precautions and are trained in the principles and
practices of IPM.
 
7. Limiting pesticide purchases to amounts needed for the year. Pesticides shall be stored at a secure location
that is not accessible to students and unauthorized staff. They shall be stored and disposed of in accordance
with state regulations and label directions registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as
well as any disposal requirements indicated on the product label.
Prohibited Pesticides
The IPM Coordinator shall not use a pesticide on a school site if that pesticide has been granted a conditional or
interim registration or an experimental use permit by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) or if
the pesticide is subject to an experimental registration issued by the EPA and either of the following conditions
exists: (Education Code 17610.1)
1. The pesticide contains a new active ingredient.
 
2. The pesticide is for new use.
In addition, the IPM Coordinator shall not use a pesticide on a school site if DPR cancels or suspends registration or
requires that the pesticide be phased out from use. (Education Code 17610.1)
Notifications
The IPM Coordinator shall annually notify staff and parents/guardians of students enrolled at a school site, in writing,
Board Policy Manual
Redwood City School District

Policy Reference Disclaimer:
regarding pesticide products expected to be applied at the school facility in the upcoming year. The notification shall
include at least the following: (Education Code 17612)
1. The Internet address (http://www.schoolipm.info) used to access information on pesticides and pesticide use
reduction developed by the DPR pursuant to Food and Agricultural Code 13184.
 
2. The name of each pesticide product expected to be applied in the upcoming year and the active ingredient(s) in
it.
 
3. An opportunity for interested persons to register to receive notification of individual pesticide application at
the school site. The IPM Coordinator shall notify such registered persons of individual pesticide applications at
least 72 hours prior to the application. The notice shall include the product name, the active ingredient(s) in the
product, and the intended date of application.
 
4. Other information deemed necessary by the Superintendent or IPM Coordinator.
If a pesticide product not included in the annual notification is subsequently intended for use at a school site, the IPM
Coordinator shall provide written notification of its intended use to staff and parents/guardians of students enrolled
at the school, at least 72 hours prior to the application. (Education Code 17612)
Whenever the IPM Coordinator deems that the immediate use of a pesticide is necessary to protect the health and
safety of students, staff, or other persons at the school site, he/she shall make every effort to provide the required
notifications prior to the application of the pesticide. (Education Code 17612)
Posting of Warning Signs
The IPM Coordinator shall post a warning sign at each area of the school site where pesticides will be applied that
shall be visible to all persons entering the treated area. The sign shall be posted at least 24 hours prior to the
application and until 72 hours after the application. The warning sign shall display the following information:
(Education Code 17612)
1. The term "Warning/Pesticide Treated Area"
 
2. The product name, manufacturer's name, and the EPA's product registration number
 
3. Intended areas and dates of application
 
4. Reason for the pesticide application
When advance posting is not possible due to an emergency condition requiring immediate use of a pesticide, the
warning sign shall be posted immediately upon application and shall remain posted until 72 hours after the
application. (Education Code 17609, 17612)
Records
Each school site shall maintain records of all pesticide use at the school for four years, and shall make the information
available to the public, upon request, in accordance with the California Public Records Act. Such records may be
maintained by retaining a copy of the warning sign posted for each pesticide application with a recording on that
copy of the amount of the pesticide used. (Education Code 17611)
