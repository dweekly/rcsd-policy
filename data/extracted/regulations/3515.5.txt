Notification to Parents/Guardians
When law enforcement has determined that parents/guardians should be notified regarding the presence of a sex
offender in the community, the Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with local law enforcement in order to
determine an appropriate response. This response may include:
1. An article in a school or parent council newsletter notifying parents/guardians that law enforcement
information about registered sex offenders is available at the local law enforcement agency headquarters
and/or at the school office.
 
2. A mailing, at law enforcement's expense, prepared by law enforcement, and printed on law enforcement
letterhead and envelopes, notifying parents/guardians of the presence of registered sex offenders.
 
3. A mailing of a letter, at district expense, prepared by law enforcement and printed on law enforcement
letterhead and envelopes, notifying parents/guardians of the presence of registered sex offenders.



The article and mailings listed above shall encourage parents/guardians to contact local law enforcement and access
the DOJ's Megan's Law website for additional information.
Whenever the principal has granted permission to a person who is required to register as a sex offender pursuant to
Penal Code 290 to come into a school building or upon school grounds to volunteer at the school, the principal or
designee shall notify the parent/guardian of each student at that school, at least 14 days in advance, that a registered
sex offender has been granted such permission, the date(s) and times for which permission has been granted, and the
parent/guardian's right to obtain information regarding the person from a designated law enforcement agency. This
notice shall be provided by regular mail or any other method normally used by the district to communicate with
parents/guardians in writing. If a parent/guardian requests such notice in electronic format, the district shall provide
electronic notice. (Education Code 48985, Penal Code 626.81)
