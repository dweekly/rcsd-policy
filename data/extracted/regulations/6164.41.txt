Definitions
Parentally-placed private school children with disabilities means children with disabilities who are voluntarily enrolled by their
parents/guardians in a private school or facility within district boundaries, including children who are attending a private
school or facility within district boundaries but who reside in another district or state. (34 CFR 300.130, 300.131)
Private school or facility means a private full-time day school, including a religious school, located within district boundaries,
that has filed an affidavit with the California Department of Education pursuant to Education Code 33190 and is registered in
the California Private School Directory.
Consultation with Private School Representatives
The Superintendent or designee shall consult with all private school representatives and representatives of parents/guardians
of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities during the design and development of equitable services for the
children. In order to ensure a meaningful and timely consultation, the consultation shall include: (Education Code 56301; 20
USC 1412(a)(10)(A)(iii); 34 CFR 300.134)
1. The child find process and how parentally-placed private school children suspected of having a disability can
participate equitably
 
2. The manner in which parents/guardians, teachers, and private school officials will be informed of the child find process
 
3. The determination of the proportionate share of federal funds available to serve parentally-placed private school
children with disabilities and how this share is calculated
 
4. How the consultation process among district staff, private school officials, and representatives of parents of parentally-
placed private school children with disabilities will operate throughout the school year to ensure that identified
children can meaningfully participate in equitable services
 
5. The provision of equitable special education and related services including how, when, and by whom such services will
be provided including a discussion about the types of services, alternate service delivery mechanisms, how services will
be apportioned if funds are insufficient to serve all of the identified children, and how and when those decisions will be
made
 
6. In the event that the district and private school disagree on the provision of or the types of services, how the district
will provide the private school officials with a written explanation of the reasons that the district chose to not provide
the services
When meaningful and timely consultation has occurred, the district shall obtain a written affirmation signed by the
representatives of participating private schools. If the private school representatives do not provide the affirmation within a
reasonable period of time, the district shall forward documentation of the consultation process to the California Department
of Education. (Education Code 56172; 20 USC 1412; 34 CFR 300.135)
After the consultation has occurred, the district shall ensure an annual count of the number of parentally-placed children with
disabilities attending private schools located within the district. This count shall be conducted between October 1 and
December 1 each year and shall be used to determine the amount the district must spend on providing equitable services to
the children in the subsequent fiscal year. (34 CFR 300.133)
Provision of Services
A child with a disability parentally-placed in a private school has no individual right to receive some or all of the special
education and related services that would have been received if enrolled in public school. Such a child may receive a
different amount of services than students with disabilities in public schools. (34 CFR 300.137, 300.138)
The district shall evaluate all identified parentally-placed private school children with disabilities for purposes of considering
them for equitable services. This evaluation shall be conducted in accordance with the timelines and procedures for
evaluating public school students with disabilities pursuant to 34 CFR 300.300-300.311 and as specified in BP/AR 6164.4 -



Identification and Evaluation of Individuals for Special Education, including obtaining parent/guardian consent and providing
the parent/guardian with a copy of the procedural safeguards notice. (34 CFR 300.131, 300.504)
If the child resides in the district and is eligible for an individualized education program (IEP), the district shall make a free
appropriate public education (FAPE) available to the child. However, the district is not required to develop an IEP if the
parent/guardian makes clear the intention to keep the child enrolled in private school. In such situations, the district shall
obtain written certification confirming the parent/guardian's intention to keep the child enrolled in private school, including
the fact that the parent/guardian is not interested in the development of an IEP or the district's offer of FAPE. If the
parent/guardian does not provide confirmation in writing, the district shall obtain oral confirmation of the parent/guardian's
intention and confirm the conversation in writing.
If the child resides in a different district, then this district and the district of residence shall work together to ensure that the
parent/guardian receives an offer of FAPE in accordance with law.
The district shall develop and implement for each identified child with a disability enrolled by their parents/guardians in a
private school within the district's boundaries an individual services plan (ISP) that describes the equitable services that the
district will provide, as determined by the district after the consultation process with private school representatives. (34 CFR
300.138)
The ISP shall be developed, reviewed, and revised consistent with 20 USC 1414. A representative of the private school shall
be invited to attend each ISP team meeting. If the representative cannot attend the meeting, the district shall use other
methods to ensure the representative's participation, including individual or conference calls. (34 CFR 300.137, 300.138)
The district may provide services on the private school premises, including a religious school, to the extent consistent with
law. The services shall be provided by personnel meeting the same standards as personnel providing services in the public
school except that private elementary school and secondary school teachers who are providing equitable services to
parentally-placed private school children with disabilities do not have to meet the special education teacher qualification
requirements specified in 34 CFR 300.156. The personnel shall either be district employees or contractors of the district. (34
CFR 300.138, 300.139)
The district shall offer transportation to the child if services are provided on a site other than the child's school and the ISP
team determines that transportation is necessary for the child to benefit from or participate in the services provided in the
ISP. Depending on the timing of the services, the district shall provide transportation from the child's school or home to the
service site and from the service site to the child's school or home. (34 CFR 300.139)
The district may place equipment and supplies in a private school for the period of time necessary to provide the services
pursuant to the ISP. All such equipment shall remain the property of the district and must be able to be removed without
remodeling or causing
damage to the private school. The district shall remove the equipment when no longer required by the child, when the child
no longer attends the private school, or when removal is necessary to prevent unauthorized use. (34 CFR 300.144)
