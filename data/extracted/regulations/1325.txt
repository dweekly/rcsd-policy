Flyers
The district is contracting with a private vendor to distribute flyers electronically whenever possible. All flyer
requests must be submitted to the vendor through the District/School website. Flyers will be approved by the
Superintendent or designee according to Board Policy 1325. Flyers approved by the Superintendent or designee for
electronic distribution may also be made available in the school office at the discretion of the site principal. All flyers
that are not generated by RCSD or its 16 schools, must include the following disclaimer:
The Redwood City School District does not endorse and is not responsible for any business, services or event
advertised in this flyer.
Web Announcements
The Superintendent or designee must approve all requests from outside organizations to post announcements on the
District website according to BP1325, BP1113 and AR1113. The Principal must approve all requests from outside
organizations to post announcements on the school website according to BP1325. Web announcements from
outside organizations are discouraged unless they are closely tied to the mission of the district and the school, such
as Walk to School Day.
Text Message Announcements
Text messages using the District's automated notification system should be limited to important information from
the school or the District.
Automated Phone Calls
Automated phone calls using the District's automated notification system should be limited to important information
from the school or the District.
Banners on School Fences
Principals may approve banners that are directly related to their school, for example a banner promoting an
upcoming play or school-sponsored event. Banners directly related to school business may be hung by school staff or
parent volunteers.
Banners that do not directly pertain to an individual school will only be hung on school fences if a facilities use form
has been filled out and approved by the Superintendent or designee according to BP1325. All requests outside of the
limited scope of no-fee promotions will pay $250/school site, and banners must be hung by the District facilities
staff. Fees collected for hanging banners will be credited to the Facilities Department budget. Banners may hang for
no more than 30 days. The District has the right to immediately remove any banner that has not gone through the
proper approval process.
Electronic Signs
Only events directly related to the school site may be promoted on a site's electronic sign.
