Reporting Complaints

the district's Title IX Coordinator. In addition, any school employee who observes an incident of sexual harassment
involving a student shall within one school day report their observation to the principal or Title IX Coordinator. The
report shall be made regardless of whether or not the alleged victim files a formal complaint or requests

When a report or complaint of sexual harassment involves off-campus conduct, the Title IX Coordinator shall assess
whether the conduct may create or contribute to the creation of a hostile school environment. If the Title IX
Coordinator determines that a hostile environment may be created, the complaint shall be investigated and resolved
in the same manner as if the prohibited conduct occurred at school.
