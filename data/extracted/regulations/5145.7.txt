student.
 
3. The conduct has the purpose or effect of having a negative impact on the student's academic performance or
of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive educational environment.
 
4. Submission to or rejection of the conduct by the student is used as the basis for any decision affecting the
student regarding benefits and services, honors, programs, or activities available at or through any district

Any prohibited conduct that occurs off campus or outside of school-related or school-sponsored programs or activities will
be regarded as sexual harassment in violation of district policy if it has a continuing effect on or creates a hostile
school environment for the complainant or victim of the conduct.

harassment is defined as any of the following forms of conduct that occurs in an education program or activity in

1. A district employee conditioning the provision of a district aid, benefit, or service on the student's participation
in unwelcome sexual conduct
 
2. Unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive
that it effectively denies a student equal access to the district's education program or activity
 
3. Sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking as defined in 20 USC 1092 or 34 USC 12291

Reporting Complaints
Any student or parent/guardian who believes that the student has been subjected to sexual harassment by another
student, an employee, or a third party or who has witnessed sexual harassment is strongly encouraged to report the
incident to their teacher, the principal, the district's Title IX Coordinator, or any other available school employee.
Within one school day of receiving such a report, the principal or other school employee shall forward the report to
the district's Title IX Coordinator. In addition, any school employee who observes an incident of sexual harassment
involving a student shall within one school day report their observation to the principal or Title IX Coordinator. The
report shall be made regardless of whether or not the alleged victim files a formal complaint or requests
confidentiality.
When a report or complaint of sexual harassment involves off-campus conduct, the Title IX Coordinator shall assess
whether the conduct may create or contribute to the creation of a hostile school environment. If the Title IX
Coordinator determines that a hostile environment may be created, the complaint shall be investigated and resolved
in the same manner as if the prohibited conduct occurred at school.
When a verbal or informal report of sexual harassment is submitted, the Title IX Coordinator shall inform the student
or parent/guardian of the right to file a formal written complaint in accordance with applicable district complaint
procedures.
Complaint Procedures

Coordinator, shall take prompt action to stop the sexual harassment, prevent recurrence, implement remedies, and
address any continuing effects.
