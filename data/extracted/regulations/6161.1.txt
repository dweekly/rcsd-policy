Instructional Materials Funding Realignment Program
The district shall use state funds received under the Instructional Materials Funding Realignment Program to ensure
that each student is provided with standards-aligned textbooks or instructional materials, as adopted by the State
Board of Education (SBE) for grades K-8, in the core curriculum areas of reading/language arts, mathematics, science,
and history/social science. (Education Code 60422)
Instructional materials for grades K-8 shall be selected from the list of standards-aligned materials adopted by the
SBE. Standards-aligned materials in each core curriculum area shall be provided to each student at the beginning of
the first school term that commences no later than 24 months after those materials are adopted by the SBE or the
Board, as applicable. (Education Code 60422)
After the Board has certified that all students have been provided with standards-aligned instructional materials in
the core curriculum areas, the district may use any remaining program funds for the purposes specified in Education
Code 60242. (Education Code 60119, 60422)
Criteria for Selection and Adoption of Instructional Materials
Instructional materials adopted by the Board shall:
1. For basic instructional materials (language arts/ELD, mathematics, science, social science) in grades K-8, be
selected from among the list of materials approved by the SBE in accordance with law (Education Code 60200)
 
2. Not reflect adversely upon persons because of their race, color, creed, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual
orientation, disability, or occupation, or contain any sectarian or denominational doctrine or propaganda
contrary to law and meet legal compliance (Education Code 60044)
 
3. To the satisfaction of the Board, be accurate, objective, current, and suited to the needs and comprehension of
students at their respective grade levels (Education Code 60045)
 
4. With the exception of literature and trade books, use proper grammar and spelling (Education Code 60045)
 
5. Not provide any exposure to a commercial brand name, product, or corporate or company logo unless the
Board makes a specific finding that the use is appropriate based on one of the following: (Education Code

purpose as defined in guidelines or frameworks adopted by the SBE.

portrayals of (1) the cultural and racial diversity of our society as specified, (2) humanity's place in ecological
systems and the need to protect the environment, and (3) the effects of tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use
on the human system. Education Code 60042 requires the Board to adopt materials as it deems necessary to
encourage thrift, fire prevention, and the humane treatment of animals and people. Education Code 60043
requires that the Board, when appropriate to the comprehension of students, adopt textbooks for social
science, history, or civics classes that contain the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the
United States.
