================================================================================

Referrals for Special Education Services
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district's child find process includes the collection of data and, at
reasonable intervals, the screening of such data to determine if students are making adequate progress, as appropriate.
A student shall be referred for special education instruction and services only after the resources of the regular education
program have been considered and used where appropriate. (Education Code 56303)
However, the district shall ensure that evaluations of children suspected of having a disability are not delayed or denied
because of the implementation of response to intervention strategies.
A parent/guardian or the district may initiate a request for an initial evaluation to determine if the student is a student with a
disability. (34 CFR 300.301)
When a verbal referral is made, staff shall offer assistance to the individual to make the request in writing and shall assist the
individual if the individual requests such assistance. (5 CCR 3021)
All referrals from school staff for an initial evaluation shall include a brief reason for the referral and description of the regular
program resources that were considered and/or modified for use with the student and, when appropriate, the results of
intervention. This documentation shall not delay the timelines for completing the assessment plan or assessment. (5 CCR
3021)
Initial Evaluation for Special Education Services
Before the initial provision of special education and related services to a student with a disability, the district shall conduct a
full and individual initial evaluation of the student. (Education Code 56320; 34 CFR 300.301)
Upon receipt of a referral of any student for special education and related services, a proposed evaluation plan shall be
developed within 15 calendar days, not counting days between the student's regular school sessions or terms or calendar
days of school vacation in excess of five school days, unless the parent/guardian agrees, in writing, to an extension. If the
referral is made within 10 days or less prior to the end of the student's regular school year or term, the proposed evaluation
plan shall be developed within 10 days after the beginning of the next regular school year or term. (Education Code 56043,
56321)
 
The proposed evaluation plan shall meet all of the following requirements: (Education Code 56321)
1. Be in a language easily understood by the general public
 
2. Be provided in the native language of the parent/guardian or other mode of communication used by the
parent/guardian unless it is clearly not feasible
 
3. Explain the types of evaluation to be conducted
 
4. State that no individualized education program (IEP) will result from the evaluation without parent/guardian consent
A copy of the notice of a parent/guardian's rights and procedural safeguards shall be attached to the evaluation plan. 
(Education Code 56321)
The proposed written evaluation plan shall include a description of recent assessments conducted, including available
independent assessments and assessment information requested by the parent/guardian to be considered, as well as
information indicating the student's primary language and the student's primary language proficiency as determined by
Education Code section 52164.1. (5 CCR 3022)
Before conducting an initial evaluation, the district shall provide the parent/guardian with prior written notice in accordance
with 34 CFR 300.503. In addition, as part of the evaluation plan, the parent/guardian shall receive written notice that
includes all of the following information: (Education Code 56329; 34 CFR 300.304, 300.502, 300.504)
1. Upon completion of the administration of tests and other evaluation materials, an IEP team meeting that includes the


parent/guardian or the parent/guardian's representative shall be scheduled pursuant to Education Code 56341. At this
meeting, the team shall determine whether or not the student is a student with disabilities, as defined in Education
Code 56026, and shall discuss the evaluation, the educational recommendations, and the reasons for the
recommendations.
 
2. When making a determination of eligibility for special education, the district shall not determine that the student is
disabled if the primary factor for such determination is lack of appropriate instruction in reading, including the essential
components of reading instruction as defined in 20 USC 6368, lack of appropriate instruction in mathematics, or limited
English proficiency, if the student does not otherwise meet the eligibility criteria under 34 CFR 300.8.
 
3. A copy of the evaluation report and the documentation of determination of eligibility shall be given to the
parent/guardian.
 
4. If the parent/guardian disagrees with an evaluation obtained by the district, the parent/guardian has the right to obtain,
at public expense, an independent educational evaluation (IEE) of the student from qualified specialists, in accordance
with 34 CFR 300.502. The parent/guardian is entitled to only one such evaluation at public expense each time the
district conducts an assessment with which the parent/guardian disagrees.
 If the district observed the student in conducting its evaluation, or if its evaluation procedures make it permissible to
have in-class observation of the student, an equivalent opportunity shall apply to the IEE. This equivalent opportunity
shall apply to the student's current placement and setting as well as observation of the district's proposed placement
and setting, if any, regardless of whether the IEE is initiated before or after the filing of a due process hearing
proceeding.
 The district may initiate a due process hearing pursuant to Education Code 56500-56508 to show that its evaluation is
appropriate. If the final decision resulting from the due process hearing is that the evaluation is appropriate, the
parent/guardian maintains the right for an IEE, but not at public expense.
If the parent/guardian obtains an IEE at private expense, the results of the IEE shall be considered by the district with
respect to the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to the student, and may be presented as
evidence at a due process hearing regarding the student. If the district observed the student in conducting its
evaluation, or if its evaluation procedures make it permissible to have in-class observation of a student, an equivalent
opportunity shall apply to an IEE of the student in the student's current educational placement and setting and in any
educational placement and setting proposed by the district, regardless of whether the IEE is initiated before or after
the filing of a due process hearing.
If the parent/guardian proposes a publicly financed placement of the student in a nonpublic school, the district shall
have an opportunity to observe the proposed placement and, if the student has already been unilaterally placed in the
nonpublic school by the student's parent/guardian, the student in that proposed placement. Any such observation shall
only be of the student who is the subject of the observation and shall not include the observation or evaluation of any
other student in the proposed placement unless that other student's parent/guardian consents to the observation or
evaluation. The results of any observation or evaluation of another student in violation of Education Code 56329(d)
shall be inadmissible in any due process or judicial proceeding regarding FAPE of that other student.
Parent/Guardian Consent for Evaluations
Upon receiving the proposed evaluation plan, the parent/guardian shall have at least 15 days to decide whether to consent to
the initial evaluation. The district shall not interpret parent/guardian consent for initial evaluation as consent for initial
placement or initial provision of special education services. (Education Code 56321; 34 CFR 300.300)
Informed parental consent means that the parent/guardian: (Education Code 56021.1; 34 CFR 300.9)
1. Has been fully informed, in the parent/guardian's native language or other mode of communication, of all information
relevant to the activity for which consent is sought
 
2. Understands and agrees, in writing, to the carrying out of the activity for which parent/guardian consent is sought and
the consent describes that activity and lists the records (if any) that will be released and to whom
 
3. Understands that the granting of consent is voluntary on the parent/guardian's part and may be revoked at any time
 
4. Understands that if the parent/guardian revokes consent, that revocation is not retroactive (i.e., it does not negate an
action that has occurred after the consent was given and before the consent was revoked). The district is not required

to amend the education records of a student to remove any reference to the student's receipt of special education and
services if the student's parent/guardian submits a written revocation of consent after the initial provision of special
education and related services to the student.
The district shall make reasonable efforts to obtain the informed consent of the parent/guardian for an initial evaluation or
reevaluation of a student. (Education Code 56321; 34 CFR 300.300, 300.322)
The district shall maintain a record of its attempts to obtain consent, which may include:
1. Detailed records of telephone calls made or attempted and the results of those calls
 
2. Copies of correspondence sent to the parent/guardian and any responses received
 
3. Detailed records of visits made to the parent/guardian's home or place of employment and the results of those visits
If a parent/guardian refuses to consent to the initial evaluation or fails to respond to a request to provide consent, the district
may, but is not required to, pursue an evaluation by utilizing the procedural safeguards, including the mediation and due
process procedures pursuant to 20 USC 1415 and 34 CFR 300.506-300.516. (Education Code 56321; 34 CFR 300.300)
For a student who is a ward of the state and not residing with the student's parent/guardian, the district shall make
reasonable efforts to obtain the informed consent from the parent of the student for an initial evaluation to determine
whether the student is a student with a disability. The district may conduct an initial evaluation without obtaining informed
consent if any of the following situations exists: (Education Code 56321.1; 20 USC 1414; 34 CFR 300.300)
1. Despite reasonable efforts to do so, the district cannot discover the whereabouts of the parent/guardian of the
student.
 
2. The rights of the parent/guardian of the student have been terminated in accordance with state law.
 
3. The rights of the parent/guardian to make educational decisions have been subrogated by a judge in accordance with
state law and consent for an initial evaluation has been given by an individual appointed by the judge to represent the
student.
The district need not obtain parent/guardian consent before reviewing existing data as part of evaluation or reevaluation, or
before administering a test or other evaluation that is administered to all students, unless consent is required from the
parents/guardians of all students. (Education Code 56321; 34 CFR 300.300)
Conduct of the Evaluation
Within 60 calendar days of receiving parental consent for the initial assessment of a student, not counting days between the
student's regular school sessions, terms, or days of school vacation in excess of five schooldays, a determination whether the
student is eligible for special education and the educational needs of the student shall be made, an IEP team meeting shall
occur, and an IEP shall be developed, unless the parent/guardian agrees in writing to an extension, pursuant to Education
Code 56344. If the 60-day time is interrupted by a student school vacation, the 60-day time shall recommence on the date
that student schooldays reconvene and a meeting to develop an IEP for the student shall be conducted within 30 days of a
determination that the student needs special education and related services. (Education Code 56043, 56344)
However, when a referral has been made for a student 30 days or less prior to the end of the regular school year, an IEP
required as a result of an assessment of the student shall be developed within
30 days after the commencement of the subsequent regular school year. (Education Code 56043, 56344; 34 CFR 300.301,
300.323)
The evaluation shall be conducted by qualified personnel who are competent to perform the assessment as determined by
the district. (Education Code 56320, 56322)
In addition, evaluations and reevaluations shall be administered by qualified personnel who are competent in the oral or sign
language skills and written skills of the student's primary language or mode of communication and have a knowledge and
understanding of the cultural and ethnic background of the student. If it is clearly not feasible to do so, an interpreter shall be
used, and the assessment report shall document this condition and note that the validity of the assessment may have been
affected. The normal process of second-language acquisition, as well as manifestations of dialect and sociolinguistic variance
shall not be diagnosed as a disabling condition. (5 CCR 3023)

The screening of a student by a teacher or specialist to determine appropriate instructional strategies for curriculum
implementation shall not be considered to be an evaluation for eligibility for special education and related services. 
(Education Code 56321; 20 USC 1414; 34 CFR 300.302)
In conducting the evaluation, the district shall use a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant functional,
developmental, and academic information about the student. The district shall also use any information provided by the
parent/guardian that may assist the district in making the determination as to whether the student is a student with a
disability and, if so, the necessary components of the student's IEP when the IEP is developed, including information related
to enabling the student to be involved in and to progress in the general education curriculum. (34 CFR 300.304)
The district's evaluation shall not use any single measure or assessment as the sole criterion for determining whether a
student is a student with a disability and for determining the appropriate educational program for the student. The
assessment shall use technically sound instruments that may assess the relative contribution of cognitive and behavioral
factors in addition to physical or developmental factors. (34 CFR 300.304)
The district shall also ensure that assessments and other evaluation materials provide relevant information that assists in
determining the student's educational needs and are: (Education Code 56320; 34 CFR 300.304)
1. Selected and administered so as not to be discriminatory on a racial, cultural, or sexual basis
 
2. Provided and administered in the student's native language or other mode of communication and in the form most
likely to yield accurate information on what the student knows and can do academically, developmentally, and
functionally, unless it is clearly not feasible to so provide or administer
 
3. Used for the purposes for which the assessments or measures are valid and reliable
 
4. Administered by trained and knowledgeable personnel except that individually administered tests of intellectual or
emotional functioning shall be administered by a credentialed school psychologist
 
5. Administered in accordance with any instructions provided by the producer of the assessment
 
6. Tailored to assess specific areas of educational need and not merely designed to provide a single general intelligence
quotient
 
7. If administered to a student with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills, selected and administered to best ensure
that the results accurately reflect the student's aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factors the test
purports to measure, rather than reflecting the child's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (unless those skills
are the factors that the test purports to measure).
Students shall be assessed in all areas related to the suspected disability, including, if appropriate, health and development,
vision (including low vision), hearing, motor abilities, language function, general intelligence, academic performance,
communicative status, self-help, orientation and mobility skills, career and vocational abilities and interests, and social and
emotional status. When appropriate, a developmental history shall be obtained. For students with residual vision, a low
vision assessment shall be provided in accordance with guidelines established pursuant to Education Code 56136. The
district shall ensure that the evaluation is sufficiently comprehensive to identify all of the student's special education and
related service needs, whether or not commonly linked to the disability category in which the student has been classified. 
(Education Code 56320; 34 CFR 300.304)
As part of the initial evaluation and any reevaluation, the IEP team and other qualified professionals shall, if appropriate,
review existing evaluation data on the student, including evaluations and information provided by the parents/guardians,
current classroom-based local or state assessments and classroom-based observations, and observations by teachers and
related services providers. On the basis of that review and input from the student's parent/guardian, the team shall identify
what additional data, if any, are needed to determine: (Education Code 56381; 34 CFR 300.305)
1. Whether the student is a student with a disability, or in the case of a reevaluation, whether the student continues to
have a disability, and the educational needs of the student
 
2. The present levels of academic achievement and related developmental needs of the student
 
3. Whether the student needs, or continues to need, special education and related services
 

4. Whether any additions or modifications to the special education and related services are needed to enable the student
to meet the measurable annual goals set out in the student's IEP and to participate, as appropriate, in the general
education curriculum
If a student has transferred from another district in the same school year or leaves this district, the district shall coordinate
with the student's prior or subsequent district as necessary and as expeditiously as possible to ensure prompt completion of
full evaluations. (34 CFR 300.304)
Evaluation Report
The personnel who evaluate the student shall prepare a written report of the results of each evaluation. The report shall
include, but not be limited to, the following: (Education Code 56327)
1. Whether the student may need special education and related services
 
2. The basis for making the determination
 
3. The relevant behavior noted during the observation of the student in an appropriate setting
 
4. The relationship of that behavior to the student's academic and social functioning
 
5. The educationally relevant health, developmental, and medical findings, if any
 
6. For students with learning disabilities, whether there is such a discrepancy between achievement and ability that it
cannot be corrected without special education and related services
 
7. A determination concerning the effects of environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage, where appropriate
 
8. The need for specialized services, materials, and equipment for students with low incidence disabilities, consistent with
Education Code 5613
Eligibility Determination
Upon completion of the administration of assessments and other evaluation measures, a group of qualified professionals and
the parent/guardian shall determine whether the student is a student with a disability as defined in 5 CCR 3030 and 34 CFR
300.8 and, if so, the student's educational needs. In interpreting the data, the group shall draw information from a variety of
sources, including aptitude and achievement tests, parent/guardian input, and teacher recommendations, as well as
information about the student's physical condition, social or cultural background, and adaptive behavior. The group shall
ensure that the information obtained from these sources is documented and carefully considered. (34 CFR 300.306)
When making a determination of eligibility for special education and related services, the district shall not determine that a
student is disabled if the primary factor for such determination is a lack of appropriate instruction in reading, including the
essential components of reading instruction pursuant to 20 USC 6368, lack of instruction in mathematics, limited English
proficiency, or that the student does not otherwise meet the eligibility criteria. (Education Code 56329; 34 CFR 300.306)
The normal process of second-language acquisition, as well as manifestations of dialect and sociolinguistic variance, shall not
be diagnosed as a disabling condition. (5 CCR 3023)
Independent Educational Evaluation
An independent educational evaluation is defined as an evaluation conducted by a qualified examiner who is not employed by
the district. (34 CFR 300.502)
Public expense means that the district either pays for the full cost of the IEE or ensures that the evaluation is otherwise
provided at no cost to the parent/guardian. (34 CFR 300.502)
The parents/guardians of a student with a disability have the right to obtain an IEE at public expense under the same criteria,
including the location of the evaluation and the qualifications of the examiner, that the district uses for a district-initiated
evaluation. (34 CFR 300.502)
The parent/guardian is entitled to only one IEE at public expense each time the district conducts an evaluation with which the
parent/guardian disagrees. (Education Code 56329; 34 CFR 300.502)


If a parent/guardian has requested an IEE, the district may ask for the reason that the parent/guardian objects to the district's
evaluation. However, the parent/guardian is not required to provide an explanation and the district may not unreasonably
delay either providing the IEE at public expense or filing a due process complaint to request a due process hearing to defend
the public evaluation. (34 CFR 300.502)
Upon receiving the request for an IEE, the district shall, without unnecessary delay, either: (34 CFR 300.502)
1. File a due process complaint to request a hearing to show that its evaluation is appropriate
 
2. Ensure that an IEE is provided at public expense, unless the district demonstrates at a hearing that the evaluation
obtained by the parent/guardian did not satisfy the district's criteria
If a due process hearing decision determines that the district's evaluation is appropriate, then the parent/guardian may obtain
an IEE but not at public expense. (Education Code 56329; 34 CFR 300.502)
In any decision made with respect to providing FAPE to a student with a disability, the result of any IEE obtained by the
student's parent/guardian shall be considered by the district if it meets district criteria. Any such result also may be presented
as evidence at a hearing on a due process complaint. (Education Code 56329; 34 CFR 300.502)
Reevaluation
A reevaluation shall be conducted when the district determines that the educational or related service needs of the student,
including improved academic achievement and functional performance, warrant a reevaluation or if the student's
parent/guardian or teacher requests reevaluation. Such reevaluations shall occur every three years, unless the
parent/guardian
and district agree in writing that a reevaluation is unnecessary. A reevaluation may not occur more than once a year, unless
the parent/guardian and the district agree otherwise. (Education Code 56043, 56381; 34 CFR 300.303)
The district shall ensure that any reevaluations of the student are conducted in accordance with the evaluation procedures
pursuant to 34 CFR 300.304-300.311. (34 CFR 300.303)
Before entering kindergarten or first grade, as the case may be, children with disabilities who are in a preschool program shall
be reevaluated to determine if they still need special education and services. IEP teams shall identify a means of monitoring
the continued success of children who are determined to be eligible for less intensive special education programs. (Education
Code 56445)
