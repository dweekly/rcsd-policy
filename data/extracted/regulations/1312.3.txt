In no instance shall a compliance officer be assigned to a complaint in which the compliance officer has a bias
or conflict of interest that would prohibit the fair investigation or resolution of the complaint. Any complaint
against a compliance officer or that raises a concern about the compliance officer's ability to investigate the
complaint fairly and without bias shall be filed with the Superintendent or designee who shall determine how
the complaint will be investigated.

receive training and are knowledgeable about the laws and programs at issue in the complaints to which they
are assigned. Training provided to such employees shall cover current state and federal laws and regulations
governing the program, applicable processes for investigating and resolving complaints, including those
alleging unlawful discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment, intimidation, or bullying), applicable
standards for reaching decisions on complaints, and appropriate corrective measures. Assigned employees
may have access to legal counsel as determined by the Superintendent or designee.
The compliance officer or, if necessary, any appropriate administrator shall determine whether interim
measures are necessary during and pending the result of an investigation. If interim measures are determined
to be necessary, the compliance officer or the administrator shall consult with the Superintendent, the
Superintendent's designee, or, if appropriate, the site principal to implement one or more interim measures.
The interim measures shall remain in place until the compliance officer determines that they are no longer
necessary or until the district issues its final written decision, whichever occurs first.

that language, in accordance with Education Code 234.1 and 48985. In all other instances, the district shall
ensure meaningful access to all relevant UCP information for parents/guardians with limited English
proficiency.
Filing of Complaints

The complaint shall be presented to the compliance officer who shall maintain a log of complaints received,
providing each with a code number and a date stamp.
All complaints shall be filed in writing and signed by the complainant. If a complainant is unable to put a
complaint in writing due to conditions such as a disability or illiteracy, district staff shall assist in the filing of
the complaint. (5 CCR 4600)
Complaints shall also be filed in accordance with the following rules, as applicable:
1. A complaint alleging district violation of applicable state or federal law or regulations governing the programs
specified in the accompanying Board policy (item #1 of the section "Complaints Subject to UCP") may be filed
by any individual, public agency, or organization. (5 CCR 4630)
 
2. Any complaint alleging noncompliance with law regarding the prohibition against student fees,
deposits, and charges or any requirement related to the LCAP may be filed anonymously if the
complaint provides evidence, or information leading to evidence, to support an allegation of
noncompliance. A complaint about a violation of the prohibition against the charging of unlawful
student fees may be filed with the principal of the school or with the Superintendent or designee.
(Education Code 49013, 52075; 5 CCR 4630)
 
3. A UCP complaint shall be filed no later than one year from the date the alleged violation occurred. For
complaints related to the LCAP, the date of the alleged violation is the date when the County
Superintendent of Schools approves the LCAP that was adopted by the Board. (5 CCR 4630)
 
4. A complaint alleging unlawful discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment, intimidation, or
bullying) may be filed only by a persons who alleges having personally suffered unlawful discrimination,
a person who believes that any specific class of individuals has been subjected to unlawful
discrimination, or a duly authorized representative who alleges that an individual student has been
subjected to discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying. The complaint shall be initiated no
later than six months from the date that the alleged unlawful discrimination occurred, or six months
from the date that the complainant first obtained knowledge of the facts of the alleged unlawful
discrimination. The time for filing may be extended for up to 90 days by the Superintendent or
designee for good cause upon written request by the complainant setting forth the reasons for the
extension. (5 CCR 4630)
 
5. When a complaint alleging unlawful discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment, intimidation, or
bullying) is filed anonymously, the compliance officer shall pursue an investigation or other response as
appropriate, depending on the specificity and reliability of the information provided and the
seriousness of the allegation.
 
6. When the complainant of unlawful discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment, intimidation, or
bullying) or the alleged victim, when not the complainant, requests confidentiality, the compliance
officer shall inform the complainant or victim that the request may limit the district's ability to
investigate the conduct or take other necessary action. When honoring a request for confidentiality,
the district shall nevertheless take all reasonable steps to investigate and resolve/respond to the
complaint consistent with the request.
Mediation
Within three business days after receiving the complaint, the compliance officer may informally discuss with
all the parties the possibility of using mediation. Mediation shall be offered to resolve complaints that
involve more than one student and no adult. However, mediation shall not be offered or used to resolve any
complaint involving an allegation of sexual assault or where there is a reasonable risk that a party to the
mediation would feel compelled to participate. If the parties agree to mediation, the compliance officer shall
make all arrangements for this process.
Before initiating the mediation of a discrimination complaint alleging retaliation or unlawful discrimination

(such as discriminatory harassment, intimidation, or bullying), the compliance officer shall ensure that all
parties agree to make the mediator a party to related confidential information. The compliance officer shall
also notify all parties of the right to end the informal process at any time.
If the mediation process does not resolve the problem within the parameters of law, the compliance officer
shall proceed with an investigation of the complaint.
The use of mediation shall not extend the district's timelines for investigating and resolving the complaint
unless the complainant agrees in writing to such an extension of time. If mediation is successful and the
complaint is withdrawn, then the district shall take only the actions agreed to through the mediation. If
mediation is unsuccessful, the district shall then continue with subsequent steps specified in this
administrative regulation.
Investigation of Complaint
Within 10 business days after the compliance officer receives the complaint, the compliance officer shall
begin an investigation into the complaint.
Within one business day of initiating the investigation, the compliance officer shall provide the complainant
and/or the complainant's representative with the opportunity to present the information contained in the
complaint to the compliance officer and shall notify the complainant and/or representative of the
opportunity to present the compliance officer with any evidence, or information leading to evidence, to
support the allegations in the complaint. Such evidence or information may be presented at any time during
the investigation.
In conducting the investigation, the compliance officer shall collect all available documents and review all
available records, notes, or statements related to the complaint, including any additional evidence or
information received from the parties during the course of the investigation. The compliance officer shall
individually interview all available witnesses with information pertinent to the complaint, and may visit any
reasonably accessible location where the relevant actions are alleged to have taken place. At appropriate
intervals, the compliance officer shall inform both parties of the status of the investigation.
To investigate a complaint alleging retaliation or unlawful discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment,
intimidation, or bullying), the compliance officer shall interview the alleged
victim(s), any alleged offenders, and other relevant witnesses privately, separately, and in a confidential
manner. As necessary, additional staff or legal counsel may conduct or support the investigation.
A complainant's refusal to provide the district's investigator with documents or other evidence related to the
allegations in the complaint, failure or refusal to cooperate in the investigation, or engagement in any other
obstruction of the investigation may result in the dismissal of the complaint because of a lack of evidence to
support the allegation. Similarly, a respondent's refusal to provide the district's investigator with documents
or other evidence related to the allegations in the complaint, failure or refusal to cooperate in the
investigation, or engagement in any other obstruction of the investigation may result in a finding, based on
evidence collected, that a violation has occurred and in the imposition of a remedy in favor of the
complainant. (5 CCR 4631)
In accordance with law, the district shall provide the investigator with access to records and other
information related to the allegation in the complaint and shall not in any way obstruct the investigation.
Failure or refusal of the district to cooperate in the investigation may result in a finding based on evidence
collected that a violation has occurred and in the imposition of a remedy in favor of the complainant. (5 CCR
4631)
Timeline for Investigation Report
Unless extended by written agreement with the complainant, the investigation report shall be sent to the
complainant within 60 calendar days of the district's receipt of the complaint. Within 30 calendar days of
receiving the complaint, the compliance officer shall prepare and send to the complainant a written report, as

described in the section “Investigation Report” below. If the complainant is dissatisfied with the compliance
officer's decision, the complainant may, within five business days, file the complaint in writing with the
Board. Due to the fact the district allows appeals to the Board, the compliance officer's decision must be
prepared and sent within 30 calendar days so that the Board's decision can still be given within the 60-day
time limit.
The Board may consider the matter at its next regular Board meeting or at a special Board meeting convened
in order to meet the 60-day time limit within which the complaint must be answered. When required by law,
the matter shall be considered in closed session. The Board may decide not to hear the complaint, in which
case the compliance officer's decision shall be final.
If the Board hears the complaint, the compliance officer shall send the Board's decision to the complainant
within 60 calendar days of the district's initial receipt of the complaint or within the time period that has
been specified in a written agreement with the complainant. (5 CCR 4631)
For any complaint alleging unlawful discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment, intimidation, and
bullying), the respondent shall be informed of any extension of the timeline agreed to by the complainant,
shall be sent the district's investigation report and, in the same manner as the complainant, may file a
complaint with the Board if dissatisfied with the decision.
Investigation Report
For all complaints, the district's investigation report shall include: 
(5 CCR 4631)
1. The findings of fact based on the evidence gathered.
 
2. A conclusion providing a clear determination for each allegation as to whether the district is in
compliance with the relevant law
 
3. Corrective action(s) whenever the district finds merit in the complaint, including, when required by law,
a remedy to all affected students and parents/guardians and, for a student fees complaint, a remedy
that complies with Education Code 49013 and 5 CCR 4600.
 
4. Notice of the complainant's right to appeal the district's investigation report to CDE, except when the
district has used the UCP to address a complaint not specified in 5 CCR 4610
 
5. Procedures to be followed for initiating an appeal to CDE
The investigation report may also include follow-up procedures to prevent recurrence or retaliation and for
reporting any subsequent problems.
In consultation with district legal counsel, information about the relevant part of an investigation report may
be communicated to a victim who is not the complainant and to other parties who may be involved in
implementing the investigation report or are affected by the complaint, as long as the privacy of the parties is
protected. In a complaint alleging unlawful discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment, intimidation,
and bullying), notice of the investigation report to the alleged victim shall include information about any
sanction to be imposed upon the respondent that relates directly to the alleged victim.
If the complaint involves a limited-English-proficient student or parent/guardian and the student involved is
enrolled in a school at which 15 percent or more of the students speak a single primary language other than
English, then the investigation report shall also be translated into that language pursuant to Education Code
48985. In all other instances, the district shall ensure meaningful access to all relevant information for
parents/guardians with limited English proficiency.
For complaints alleging unlawful discrimination based on state law (such as discriminatory harassment,
intimidation, and bullying), the investigation report shall also include a notice to the complainant that:

1. The complainant may pursue available civil law remedies outside of the district's complaint procedures,
including seeking assistance from mediation centers or public/private interest attorneys, 60 calendar days after
the filing of an appeal with the CDE. (Education Code 262.3)
 
2. The 60 days moratorium does not apply to complaints seeking injunctive relief in state courts or to
discrimination complaints based on federal law. (Education Code 262.3)
 
3. Complaints alleging discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, gender, disability, or age
may also be filed with the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights at www.ed.gov/ocr
within 180 days of the alleged discrimination.
Corrective Actions
When a complaint is found to have merit, the compliance officer shall adopt any appropriate corrective
action permitted by law. Appropriate corrective actions that focus on the larger school or district
environment may include, but are not limited to, actions to reinforce district policies; training for faculty,
staff, and students; updates to school policies; or school climate surveys.
For complaints involving retaliation or unlawful discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment,
intimidation, or bullying), appropriate remedies that may be offered to the victim but not communicated to
the respondent may include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. Counseling
 
2. Academic support
 
3. Health services
 
4. Assignment of an escort to allow the victim to move safely about campus
 
5. Information regarding available resources and how to report similar incidents or retaliation
 
6. Separation of the victim from any other individuals involved, provided the separation does not penalize
the victim
 
7. Restorative justice
 
8. Follow-up inquiries to ensure that the conduct has stopped and there has been no retaliation
For complaints involving retaliation or unlawful discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment,
intimidation, or bullying), appropriate corrective actions that focus on a student offender may include, but are
not limited to, the following:
1. Transfer from a class or school as permitted by law
 
2. Parent/guardian conference
 
3. Education regarding the impact of the conduct on others
 
4. Positive behavior support
 
5. Referral to a student success team
 
6. Denial of participation in extracurricular or co-curricular activities or other privileges as permitted by
law
 
7. Disciplinary action, such as suspension or expulsion, as permitted by law
When an employee is found to have committed retaliation or unlawful discrimination (such as discriminatory
harassment, intimidation, or bullying), the district shall take appropriate disciplinary action, up to and

including dismissal, in accordance with applicable law and collective bargaining agreement.
The district may also consider training and other interventions for the larger school community to ensure
that students, staff, and parents/guardians understand the types of behavior that constitute unlawful
discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment, intimidation, or bullying), that the district does not tolerate
it, and how to report and respond to it.
When a complaint is found to have merit, an appropriate remedy shall be provided to the complainant or
other affected person.
However, if a complaint alleging noncompliance with the laws regarding student fees, deposits, and other
charges, physical education instructional minutes for students in elementary schools, or any requirement
related to the LCAP is found to have merit, the district shall provide a remedy to all affected students and
parents/guardians subject to procedures established by regulation of the State Board of Education. 
(Education Code 49013, 51223, 52075)
For complaints alleging noncompliance with the laws regarding student fees, the district shall attempt in
good faith, by engaging in reasonable efforts, to identify and fully reimburse all affected students and
parents/guardians who paid the unlawful student fees within one year prior to the filing of the complaint. 
(Education Code 49013; 5 CCR 4600)
Appeals to the California Department of Education
Any complainant who is dissatisfied with the district's investigation report on a complaint regarding any
specified federal or state educational program subject to UCP may file an appeal in writing with CDE within
30 calendar days of receiving the district's investigation report. (5 CCR 4632)
The appeal shall be sent to CDE with a copy of the original locally filed complaint and a copy of the district's
investigation report for that complaint. The complainant shall specify and explain the basis for the appeal,
including as least one of the following: (5 CCR 4632) 
1. The district failed to follow its complaint procedures.
 
2. Relative to the allegations of the complaint, the district's investigation report lacks material findings of
fact necessary to reach a conclusion of law.
 
3. The material findings of fact in the district's investigation report are not supported by substantial
evidence.
 
4. The legal conclusion in the district's investigation report is inconsistent with the law.
 
5. In a case in which the district found noncompliance, the corrective actions fail to provide a proper
remedy.
Upon notification by CDE that the district's investigation report has been appealed, the Superintendent or
designee shall forward the following documents to CDE within 10 days of the date of notification: (5 CCR
4633)
1. A copy of the original complaint
 
2. A copy of the district's investigation report
 
3. A copy of the investigation file including, but not limited to, all notes, interviews, and documents
submitted by the parties and gathered by the investigator
 
4. A report of any action taken to resolve the complaint
 
5. A copy of the district's UCP
 


6. Other relevant information requested by CDE
If notified by CDE that the district's investigation report failed to address allegation(s) raised by the
complaint, the district shall, within 20 days of the notification, provide CDE and the appellant with an
amended investigation report that addresses the allegation(s) that were not addressed in the original
investigation report. The amended report shall also inform the appellant of the right to separately appeal the
amended report with respect to the allegation(s) that were not addressed in the original report. (5 CCR
4632)
