Identification of Students with Asthma
When registering their child for school and annually thereafter, parents/guardians of all students shall be requested
to notify the principal or designee, in writing, if their child has been diagnosed with asthma, has recently experienced
symptoms or has a history of asthma, and/or is at risk for severe asthma attacks. Parents/guardians shall provide
authorization for the limited release of medical information related to their child's health records in order for the
district to provide support services or to respond in an emergency. The principal or designee shall so notify the
student's teacher(s), school nurse, coach(es), bus driver, and any other staff with responsibility for direct supervision
of the student.
Plan for Individualized Asthma Management
The Superintendent or designee shall request the parents/guardians of each student identified with asthma to
annually submit an asthma action plan developed by the student's health care provider in partnership with the
student and his/her parents/guardians. The action plan shall include, but not be limited to, information regarding the
student's symptoms and severity, asthma triggers, medications needed by the student, and authorization for
disclosure of health information to the district. For students identified as disabled pursuant to Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, necessary accommodations and services
shall be identified as part of the student's 504 accommodation plan or individualized education program (IEP), as
appropriate.
Any student who needs to take prescribed medication during the school day may be assisted by a school nurse or
designated school personnel or allowed to carry and self-administer inhaled asthma medication provided that the
district receives written statements from the student's physician and parent/guardian in accordance with Education
Code 49423.1 and BP/AR 5141.21 - Administering Medication and Monitoring Health Conditions.
Students shall be encouraged to notify their teacher, coach, or other staff when they are experiencing symptoms
and/or need to alter their physical activity level.
Upon request by the student or his/her parents/guardians, the Superintendent or designee may provide information
about available medical resources, including school-based health services as appropriate.
Emergency Response
In case of emergency, staff shall call 911 and administer quick-relief medication as authorized in the student's asthma
action plan, accommodation plan, or IEP. Staff shall also continue to supervise the student and contact his/her
parent/guardian or other person identified as an emergency contact.
The Superintendent or designee shall provide each school site with information regarding emergency management of
asthma to post in easily accessible locations.
Professional Development
Staff shall be provided professional development which includes information about symptoms and common triggers
of asthma, ways to reduce acute symptoms, and emergency response procedures. The professional development
shall be provided by a school nurse or other qualified health professional or educator who has received related
training.
Environmental Assessment
The Superintendent or designee shall periodically conduct an environmental assessment to identify and reduce
common asthma triggers in the school environment, including, but not limited to, pesticides, chemical pollutants,
mold, and animal and dust mite allergens.
The Superintendent or designee shall communicate with each school principal when local health advisories are issued
for high ozone days or poor outdoor air quality so that outdoor physical activities may be curtailed as necessary.
