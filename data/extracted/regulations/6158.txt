independent study agreement pursuant to Education Code 51747 or the written learning agreement pursuant to Education
Code 51749.6. (Education Code 51745.5)
Synchronous instruction means classroom-style instruction or designated small group or one-on-one instruction delivered

Educational Opportunities
Educational opportunities offered through independent study may include, but are not limited to: (Education Code 51745)
1. Special assignments extending the content of regular courses of instruction
 
2. Individualized study in a particular area of interest or in a subject not currently available in the regular school

4. Volunteer community service activities that support and strengthen student achievement
 
5. Individualized study for a student whose health, as determined by the student's parent/guardian, would be put at risk
by in-person instruction
In addition, when requested by the parent/guardian due to emergencies, vacation or illness, independent study may be used on a
short-term basis to ensure that the student is able to maintain academic progress in his/her regular classes.
Equivalency
The district's independent study option shall be substantially equivalent in quality and quantity to classroom instruction to
enable participating students to complete the district's adopted course of study within the customary timeframe. Students in
independent study shall have access to the same services and resources that are available to other students in the school and
shall have equal rights and privileges. (5 CCR 11700, 11701.5)
Students participating in independent study shall have access to Internet connectivity and devices adequate to participate in
the educational program and complete assigned work. (Education Code 51747)
The district shall not provide independent study to students and their parents/guardians with funds or items of value that are
not provided for other students and their parents/guardians. (Education Code 46300.6, 51747.3)
Providing access to Internet connectivity and district-owned devices adequate to participate in an independent study
program and complete assigned work consistent with Education Code 51747, or to participate in an independent study
course, as authorized by Education Code 51749.5, shall not be considered funds or other things of value. (Education Code
46300.6, 51747.3)
Eligibility for Independent Study
To participate in independent study, a student shall be enrolled in a district school. (Education Code 51748)
Board Policy Manual
Redwood City School District

The Superintendent or designee may approve the participation of a student who demonstrates the motivation, commitment,
organizational skills, and academic skills necessary to work independently provided that experienced certificated staff are
available to effectively supervise students in independent study. The Superintendent or designee may also approve the
participation of a student whose health would be put at risk by in-person instruction. A student whose academic
performance is not at grade level may participate in independent study only if the program is able to provide appropriate
support, such as supplemental instruction, tutoring, counseling, ongoing diagnostic assessments, and/or differentiated
materials, to enable the student to be successful. For an elementary student, the Superintendent or designee may consider
the parent/guardian's level of commitment to assist the student.
A student participating in independent study must be a resident of the county or an adjacent county. Full-time independent
study shall not be available to students whose district residency status is based on their parent/guardian's employment within
district boundaries pursuant to Education Code 48204.
A student with disabilities, as defined in Education Code 56026, may participate in independent study if the student's
individualized education program (IEP) specifically provides for such participation. If a parent/guardian of a student with
disabilities requests independent study because the student’s health would be put at risk by in-person instruction, the
student’s IEP team shall make an individualized determination as to whether the student can receive a free appropriate public
education (FAPE) in an independent study placement. A student’s inability to work independently, need for adult support, or
need for special education or related services shall not preclude the IEP team from determining that the student can receive
FAPE in an independent study placement. (Education Code 51745)
In addition, any student with disabilities who receives services from a nonpublic, nonsectarian school through a virtual
program may be permitted to participate in independent study if the student’s IEP team determines that FAPE can be
provided to the student by means of the virtual program and other conditions of law are satisfied.
A temporarily disabled student shall not receive individual instruction pursuant to Education Code 48206.3 through
independent study. (Education Code 51745)
Monitoring Student Progress
The independent study administrator and/or supervising teacher shall promptly and directly address any failure by the
student to meet the terms of the student's written agreement. The following supportive strategies may be used:
1. A letter to the student and/or parent/guardian
 
2. A meeting between the student and the teacher and/or counselor
 
3. A meeting between the student and the independent study administrator, including the parent/guardian if appropriate
 
4. An increase in the amount of time the student works under direct supervision
When the student has failed to make satisfactory educational progress or missed the number of assignments specified in the
written agreement as requiring an evaluation, the Superintendent or designee shall conduct an evaluation to determine
whether independent study is in the student's best interest. This evaluation may result in termination of the independent
study agreement and the student's return to the regular classroom program or other alternative program. (Education Code
51747, 51749.5; 5 CCR 11701)
A written record of the findings of any such evaluation shall be treated as a mandatory interim student record which shall be
maintained for three years from the date of the evaluation, and, if the student transfers to another public school in California,
the record shall be forwarded to that school. (Education Code 51747, 51749.5)
Responsibilities of Independent Study Administrator
The responsibilities of the independent study administrator include, but are not limited to:
1. Recommending certificated staff to be assigned as independent study teachers at the required teacher-student ratios
pursuant to Education Code 51745.6 and supervising staff assigned to independent study functions who are not
regularly supervised by another administrator
 
2. Approving or denying the participation of students requesting independent study
 
3. Facilitating the completion of written independent study agreements

4. Ensuring a smooth transition for students into and out of the independent study mode of instruction

Assignment and Responsibilities of Independent Study Teachers
Each student's independent study shall be coordinated, evaluated, and carried out under the general supervision of a district
employee who possesses a valid certification document pursuant to Education Code 44865 or emergency credential pursuant
to Education Code 44300, registered as required by law, and who consents to the assignment. (Education Code 44865,
51747.5; 5 CCR 11700)
The ratio of student average daily attendance for independent study students age 18 years or younger to full-time equivalent
certificated employees responsible for independent study shall not exceed the equivalent ratio for all other education
programs in the district, unless a new higher or lower ratio for all other educational programs offered is negotiated in a
collective bargaining agreement or the district enters into a memorandum of understanding that indicates an existing
collective bargaining agreement contains an alternative ratio. (Education Code 51745.6)
The responsibilities of the supervising teacher shall include, but are not limited to:
1. Completing designated portions of the written independent study agreement and signing the agreement
 
2. Supervising and approving coursework and assignments
 
3. Maintaining records of student assignments showing the date the assignment is given and the date the assignment is
due
