District staff shall enforce standards of appropriate student conduct in order to provide a safe and secure environment for 
students and staff on campus but are prohibited from using seclusion and behavioral restraint to control student behavior 
except as authorized by law when the behavior poses a clear and present danger of serious physical harm to the student, 
other students, or others on campus, and that cannot be immediately prevented by a less restrictive response.
Definitions
Behavioral restraint includes mechanical restraint or physical restraint used as an intervention when a student presents an 
immediate danger to self or to others. Behavioral restraint does not include postural restraints or devices used to improve a 
student's mobility and independent functioning rather than to restrict movement. (Education Code 49005.1)
Mechanical restraint means the use of a device or equipment to restrict a student's freedom of movement. Mechanical 
restraint does not include the use of devices as prescribed by an appropriate medical or related services professional, 
including, but not limited to, adaptive devices or mechanical supports used to achieve proper body position, balance, or 
alignment; vehicle safety restraints during the transport of a student; restraints for medical immobilization; or orthopedically 
prescribed devices which permit a student to participate in activities without risk of harm. Mechanical restraint also does not 
include the use of devices by peace officers or security personnel for detention or for public safety purposes. (Education 
Code 49005.1)
Physical restraint means a personal restriction that immobilizes or reduces the ability of a student to move the torso, arms, 
legs, or head freely. Physical restraint does not include a physical escort in which a staff member temporarily touches or holds 
the student's hand, wrist, arm, shoulder, or back for the purpose of inducing a student who is acting out to walk to a safe 
location. Physical restraint also does not include the use of force by peace officers or security personnel for detention or for 
public safety purposes. (Education Code 49005.1)
Prone restraint means the application of a behavioral restraint on a student in a facedown position. (Education Code 
49005.1)
Seclusion means the involuntary confinement of a student alone in a room or an area from which the student is physically 
prevented from leaving. Seclusion does not include a timeout involving the monitored separation of the student in an 
unlocked setting, which is implemented for the purpose of calming the student. (Education Code 49005.1)
Prohibitions
Seclusion and behavioral restraint of students shall not be used in any form as a means of coercion, discipline, convenience, 
or retaliation. (Education Code 49005.8)
In addition, staff shall not take any of the following actions: (Education Code 49005.2, 49005.8)
1. 
 
Administer a drug that is not a standard treatment for a student's medical or psychiatric condition in order to control 
the student's behavior or restrict the student's freedom of movement
 
 
2. 
 
Use locked seclusion, unless it is in a facility otherwise licensed or permitted by state law to use as a locked room
 
 
3. 
 
Use a physical restraint technique that obstructs a student's respiratory airway or impairs a student's breathing or 


respiratory capacity, including a technique in which a staff member places pressure on the student's back or places the 
staff member's body weight against the student's torso or back
 
 
4. 
 
Use a behavioral restraint technique that restricts breathing, including, but not limited to, the use of a pillow, blanket, 
carpet, mat, or other item to cover a student's face
 
 
5. 
 
Place a student in a facedown position with the student's hands held or restrained behind the student's back
 
 
6. 
 
Use a behavioral restraint for longer than is necessary to contain the behavior that poses a clear and present danger of 
serious physical harm to the student or others
 
Limited Use of Seclusion or Restraint
Staff shall avoid the use of seclusion and behavioral restraint of students whenever possible. Seclusion or behavioral restraint 
may be used only to control student behavior that poses a clear and present danger of serious physical harm to the student or 
others, which cannot be immediately prevented by a response that is less restrictive. (Education Code 49005.4, 49005.6, 
49005.8)
When used, seclusion or restraint shall not be applied for longer than is necessary to contain the dangerous behavior. For any 
situation that requires a prolonged use of an emergency intervention, staff shall seek the assistance of the principal or law 
enforcement agency, as applicable to the situation. (Education Code 56521.1)
If a student is put in seclusion, the student shall be under constant, direct observation of a staff member. Such observation 
may be through a window or another barrier through which the staff member is able to make direct eye contact with the 
student, but shall not be made through indirect means such as a security camera or closed-circuit television. (Education Code 
49005.8)
If a student is restrained, staff shall afford the student the least restrictive alternative and the maximum freedom of 
movement, and shall use the least number of restraint points, while ensuring the physical safety of the student and others. 
(Education Code 49005.8)
If a prone restraint technique is used on a student, a staff member shall observe the student for any signs of physical distress 
throughout the use of the restraint. Whenever possible, the staff member monitoring the student shall not be involved in 
restraining the student. (Education Code 49005.8)
Seclusion or restraint may only be applied to a student with disabilities in accordance with rules specified in AR 6159.4 
Behavioral Interventions For Special Education Students. Staff may not apply seclusion or restraint to students with 
disabilities based on assumptions or stereotypes about disabilities or students with disabilities or for behavior that would not 
result in restraint or seclusion for students without disabilities.
The superintendent or designee shall provide training to staff in the safe and effective use of seclusion and restraint as 
appropriate.
Documentation of Seclusion and Restraint


Parents/guardians and, if appropriate, residential care providers shall be notified within one school day whenever an 
emergency intervention is used or serious property damage occurs. (Education Code 56521.1)
A behavior emergency report shall be completed and forwarded to the Superintendent or designee for review. This report 
shall include: (Education Code 56521.1)
1. 
 
The name and age of the student
 
 
2. 
 
The setting and location of the incident
 
 
3. 
 
The name of the staff or other persons involved
 
 
4. 
 
A description of the incident and the emergency intervention used
 
 
5. 
 
A statement of whether the student is currently engaged in a systematic behavior intervention plan
 
 
6. 
 
Details of any injuries sustained by the student or others, including staff, as a result of the incident
 
Reports
The Superintendent or designee shall annually collect data on the number of times that seclusion, mechanical restraint, and 
physical restraint were used on students and the number of students subjected to such techniques. The data shall be 
disaggregated by race/ethnicity and gender, and reported for students with a Section 504 plan, students with an 
individualized education program, and all other students. This report shall be submitted to the California Department of 
Education no later than three months after the end of each school year, and shall be available as a public record pursuant to 
Government Code 6250-6270. (Education Code 49006)
