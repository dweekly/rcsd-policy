Definitions
Chronic absentee means a student who is absent for any reason on 10 percent or more of the school days in the
school year, when the total number of days the student is absent is divided by the total number of days the student is
enrolled and school was actually taught in the regular schools of the district, exclusive of Saturdays and Sundays. 
(Education Code 60901)
Truant means a student who is absent from school without a valid excuse three full days in one school year, or tardy
or absent for more than any 30-minute period during the school day without a valid excuse on three occasions in one
school year, or any combination thereof. (Education Code 48260)
Habitual truant means a student who has been reported as a truant three or more times within the same school year,
provided the district has made a conscientious effort to hold at least one conference with the student and the
student's parent/guardian after either of the two previous reports. (Education Code 48262, 48264.5)
Chronic truant means a student who has been absent from school without a valid excuse for 10 percent or more of
the school days in one school year, from the date of enrollment to the current date, provided the district has met the
requirements of Education Code 48260, 48260.5, 48261, 48262, 48263, and 48291. (Education Code 48263.6)
For purposes of classifying a student as a truant, a valid excuse includes, but is not limited to, the reasons for which a
student shall be excused from school pursuant to Education Code 48205 and 48225.5, and Administrative
Regulation 5113 - Absences and Excuses. A valid excuse may include other reasons that are within the discretion of
school administrators and, based on the facts of the student's circumstances, are deemed to constitute a valid
excuse. (Education Code 48260)
Addressing Chronic Absence
When a student is identified as a chronic absentee, the Superintendent, attendance supervisor, or designee shall
communicate with the student and the student's parents/guardians to determine the reason(s) for the excessive
absences, ensure the student and parents/guardians are aware of the adverse consequences of poor attendance, and
jointly develop a plan for improving the student's school attendance.
The student may be referred to a student success team or school-site attendance review team to assist in evaluating
the student's needs and identifying strategies and programs to assist the student. When necessary, the student may
be referred to a school attendance review board (SARB) program, a truancy mediation program established by the
district attorney or the probation officer, or a comparable program deemed acceptable by the Superintendent or
designee, in accordance with Education Code 48263 and Item #3 in "Addressing Truancy" below.
A student who is struggling academically may be offered tutoring or other supplemental instruction, expanded
learning opportunities, and/or alternative educational options as appropriate.
Students who are absent shall be given an opportunity to make up missed assignments or assessments and shall
receive full credit for satisfactory completion of the work. Students with excessive absences shall be supported to
the extent possible to limit the impact of absences on the student's grades.
Whenever chronic absenteeism is linked to a health, social-emotional, family, or other nonschool issue, the
Superintendent or designee may recommend school or community resources and/or collaborate with community
agencies and organizations to address the needs of the student and the student's family.
Addressing Truancy
An attendance supervisor or designee, peace officer, probation officer, or school administrator or designee may, as
applicable, arrest or assume temporary custody during school hours of any minor student found away from home
who is absent from school without a valid excuse. Any person arresting or assuming temporary custody of a minor
student shall deliver the student and make reports in accordance with Education Code 48265 and 48266. 
(Education Code 48264, 48265, 48266)
