Universal Precautions in the Classroom
Before students work with blood, blood products, or other body fluids, the teacher shall explain the potentially
hazardous nature of blood and body fluids in the transmission of various agents from one person to another and the
specific procedures and safety precautions to be used in the lesson.
The following precautions shall be used when students are working with blood or other body fluids:

and cover any existing cut, wound, or open sore with a sterile dressing.
 
2. Students shall wear gloves or other personal protective equipment as appropriate.
 
3. Blood typing or similar experiments may be conducted by teacher demonstrations. When being performed
individually, students shall work with their own blood or use prepackaged ABO/Rh blood cell kits that have
vials of blood previously tested for transmissible agents.



a. For finger punctures, students shall use individual sterile lancets that have engineered sharps injury
protection and shall not reuse them.
 
b. Before the finger is punctured, it shall be wiped with a piece of cotton that has been immersed in
alcohol.
 
c. If bleeding persists after the finger is punctured, the student shall apply a sterile bandage using moderate
pressure.

consisting of one part bleach to 10 parts water (1:10), made fresh daily.
