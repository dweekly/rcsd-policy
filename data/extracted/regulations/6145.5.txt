================================================================================

In order to maintain a closed forum at district schools, each principal or designee shall ensure that all school-
sponsored student organizations are curriculum-related. In order to qualify as "curriculum-related," a student group
shall meet one or more of the following criteria:
1. The subject matter of the group is currently taught or will be taught in a regularly scheduled course.
 
2. The subject matter of the group concerns the body of courses as a whole (e.g., student government).
 
3. Participation in the group is required for a particular course.
 
4. Participation in the group results in academic credit.
Meetings may also be held during the lunch period.
Meetings held within the limited open forum shall entail no expenditure of public funds beyond the incidental cost of
providing the meeting space. (20 USC 4071)
Students shall leave the meeting place in a clean, orderly, and secure condition after their meetings. The
Superintendent or designee may deny the use of facilities to any group that he/she believes will materially disrupt
the school program or threaten the health and safety of students and staff. (20 USC 4071)
Authorization for Student Groups
Any student wishing to create either a curriculum- or noncurriculum-related student group shall first request
authorization from the principal or designee. The group shall provide the principal or designee with the following
information:
1. Name of the organization and names of student contacts
 
2. A statement of the organization's purposes, objectives, and activities
 
3. A copy of the proposed bylaws of the student group, including a description of how officers will be selected, as
well as the bylaws of any off-campus organization with which the group may be affiliated
 
4. The name of the proposed faculty advisor, if any
 
5. The proposed dates, times, and location of meetings
 
6. Any special equipment to be used
 
7. A description of the qualifications for membership, if any
 
8. If a curriculum-related group, a statement of the relation of the club to the curriculum and/or instructional
program
The principal or designee may establish school rules governing the meetings of curriculum-related groups, such as
attendance or grade requirements. Such rules may vary depending on the group, such as whether or not academic
credit is given for participation in the group.
Role of Staff Adviser
For any curriculum-related student group, the staff adviser shall provide guidance and teaching to students to ensure
that the group's activities are aligned to the district's goals and objectives and shall provide supervision and
leadership of the group. The principal shall have final authority in determining the assignment and role of the staff
adviser.
For noncurriculum-related student groups, a staff adviser may be assigned voluntarily to observe meetings for
purposes of maintaining order and protecting student safety. Staff advisers and other school employees shall not
promote, lead, or participate in the meetings. (20 USC 4071, 4072)



A school employee may refuse to attend a meeting of a student group if the content of the speech at the meeting is
contrary to the employee's beliefs. (20 USC 4071)
Hazing
Any student who engages in hazing may be subject to discipline including, but not limited to, suspension or expulsion.
Hazing means a method of initiation or pre-initiation into a student organization or body, whether or not the
organization or body is officially recognized by the district, which is likely to cause serious bodily injury or personal
degradation or disgrace resulting in physical or mental harm to a former, current, or prospective student. (Education
Code 48900)
