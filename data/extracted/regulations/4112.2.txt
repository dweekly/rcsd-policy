The Superintendent or designee shall maintain records of the appropriate certification of all employees serving in certificated
positions.
Basic Skills Proficiency Test
Prior to being hired by the Board of Education, all certificated persons, whether hired on a permanent, temporary, or

from this requirement by law or by fulfilling an alternative indicator of basic proficiency authorized by law. (Education Code
44252, 44252.6, 44830)
The district may hire a certificated employee, if they have not yet been afforded the opportunity to take the test, provided

The district shall submit a copy of the agenda item presented at a public Board meeting which shall state the name of
the applicant, the assignment in which the applicant will be employed including the name of the school, subject(s), and
grade(s) that he/she will be teaching, and that the applicant will be employed on the basis of a provisional internship

Teaching Permit for Statutory Leave
Whenever there is an anticipated need for the district to temporarily fill the teaching assignment of a teacher of record who

hours of preparation in the content areas listed in 5 CCR 80022. (5 CCR 80022)
A request for the TPSL shall only be submitted if the district has made reasonable efforts to hire a substitute with a full
teaching credential that matches the setting and/or subject for the statutory leave position and no such candidate is available.
(5 CCR 80022)
The district shall verify to the CTC that it will provide the interim teacher: (5 CCR 80022)

statutory leave assignment
 
3. Lesson plans for the first four weeks of the assignment as well as continued assistance in the development of
curriculum, lesson planning, and individualized education programs
The holder of the TPSL may serve as the interim teacher of record for up to the full length of the leave(s) during the school
year. (5 CCR 80022)
The Superintendent or designee shall maintain documentation on the assignment in accordance with 5 CCR 80022. He/she
shall annually report data on the use of the TPSL to the County Superintendent of Schools for assignment monitoring

teacher has completed an additional 45 hours of preparation and the district is continuing to provide mentoring in accordance
with items #2-3 above. (5 CCR 80022)

The Superintendent or designee shall provide any first-time recipient of an emergency teaching permit with an orientation
which, to the extent reasonably feasible, shall occur before he/she begins a teaching assignment. The Superintendent or
designee may vary the nature, content, and duration of the orientation to match the amount of training and experience
previously completed by the emergency permit teacher. The orientation shall include, but not be limited to, the curriculum
the teacher is expected to teach and effective techniques of classroom instruction and classroom management at the
assigned grade-level span. The emergency permit holder also shall receive guidance and assistance from an experienced

education and who has completed at least three years of full-time classroom teaching experience. (5 CCR 80026.5)
