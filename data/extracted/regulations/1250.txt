The Superintendent or designee shall post at every entrance to each school and school grounds a notice setting forth
visitor registration requirements, hours during which registration is required, the registration location, the route to
take to that location, and the penalties for violation of registration requirements. (Penal Code 627.6)
Unless otherwise directed by the principal or designee, a staff member shall accompany visitors while they are on
school grounds.
Registration Procedure
In order to register, outsiders shall, upon request, furnish the principal or designee with the following information:
(Penal Code 627.3)
1. His/her name, address and occupation
 
2. His/her age, if less than 21
 
3. His/her purpose for entering school grounds
 
4. Proof of identity
 
5. Other information consistent with the provisions of law
Denial of Registration
The following provisions of law shall apply to visitors. Visitors do not include students, parents/guardians, district
employees, elected public officials, or other persons listed in Penal Code 627.1.
1. The principal or designee may refuse to register any visitor/outsider if he/she reasonably concludes that the
visitor's presence or acts would disrupt the school, students, or employees; would result in damage to
property; or would result in the distribution or use of a controlled substance. The principal or designee or
school security officer may revoke a visitor's registration if he/she has a reasonable basis for concluding that
the outsider's presence on school grounds would interfere or is interfering with the peaceful conduct of school
activities or would disrupt or is disrupting the school, students or staff. (Penal Code 627.4)
 
2. The principal or designee may request that a visitor who has failed to register, or whose registration privileges
have been denied or revoked, promptly leave school grounds. When a visitor is directed to leave, the principal
or designee shall inform the visitor/outsider that if he/she reenters the school within seven days he/she will be
guilty of a misdemeanor subject to a fine and/or imprisonment. (Penal Code 627.7)
Appeal Procedure
Any person who is denied registration or whose registration is revoked may appeal to the Superintendent or principal
by submitting, within five days after the person's departure from school, a written request for a hearing. This request
must state why he/she believes the denial or revocation was improper and must provide an address to which the
hearing notice may be sent. Upon receipt of the request for a hearing, the Superintendent or principal shall promptly
mail a notice of the hearing to the person requesting it. A hearing before the Superintendent or principal shall be held
within seven days after receipt of the request. (Penal Code 627.5)
