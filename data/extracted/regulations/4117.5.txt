If a termination settlement agreement has been made with an employee, the Superintendent or designee shall inform
prospective employers, upon request for an employment reference, that an agreement exists and that he/she may
only provide information as provided for in the agreement.
Cash settlements made upon the termination of a contract shall never exceed an amount equal to the employee's
monthly salary multiplied by the number of months, up to 18, in the unexpired term of the contract. This amount is a
maximum ceiling, not to be construed as a target amount for settlement agreements. (Government Code 53260)
Settlement agreements shall not include noncash items other than health benefits, which the district may offer to
continue for the unexpired term up to 18 months or until the employee finds other employment, whichever comes
first. (Government Code 53261)
Copies of settlement agreements with a superintendent, deputy superintendent, assistant superintendent, associate
superintendent or other similar chief administrative officer or chief executive officer shall be made available to the
public upon request. (Government Code 53262)
