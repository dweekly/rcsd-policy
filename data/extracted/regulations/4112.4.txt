Tuberculosis Tests
No applicant shall be initially employed in a classified or certificated position unless he/she has submitted to an
intradermal or other tuberculin test licensed by the Food and Drug Administration within the past 60 days and, if that
test was positive, has subsequently obtained an X-ray of the lungs. The applicant shall submit to the district a
certificate signed by the examining licensed physician indicating that he/she is free of active tuberculosis. (Education
Code 49406; 5 CCR 5503)
The cost of the pre-employment tuberculosis examination shall be paid by the applicant.
An applicant who was previously employed in another California school district may fulfill the tuberculosis
examination requirement by either producing a certificate showing that he/she was examined within the last four
years and found to be free of active tuberculosis or by having his/her previous school district employer verify that it
has on file a certificate which contains that evidence. (Education Code 49406)
Once hired by the district, employees who test negative on the initial intradermal or other tuberculin test shall
undergo a tuberculosis examination at least once every four years, or more often if so directed by the Board of
Education upon recommendation of the county health officer, for as long as the employee's test remains negative.
An employee with a documented positive test for tuberculosis infection shall no longer be required to submit to the
examination and shall be referred to the county health officer within 30 days of the examination to determine the
need for follow-up care. (Education Code 49406)
Tuberculosis tests for employees shall be provided at district expense up to a maximum of $120.00. (Education Code
44839, 45122, 49406)
If an employee's religious belief prevents him/her from undergoing a tuberculosis examination, the employee shall
file an affidavit stating that he/she adheres to the faith or teachings of a well-recognized religious sect,
denomination, or organization and, in accordance with its creed, tenets, or principles, depends for healing upon
prayer in the practice of religion and that to the best of his/her knowledge or belief he/she is free from active
tuberculosis. In order to exempt the individual, the Board shall determine by resolution, after a hearing, that the
health of students would not be jeopardized. (Education Code 49406)
The Superintendent or designee may exempt a pregnant employee from the requirement that a positive tuberculin
test be followed by an X-ray of the lungs, for a period not to exceed 60 days following termination of the pregnancy.
(Education Code 49406)
Medical Certification for Communicable Diseases for Certificated Employees
When a new employee in a position requiring certification has not previously been employed in such a position in
California or a retirant has not previously been employed as a retirant, he/she shall have a medical certificate on file
with the district stating that he/she is free from any disabling disease which would render him/her unfit to instruct or
associate with children. The certificate shall be completed by a licensed physician and returned to the district by the
physician. The medical examination referred to in the certificate must have been conducted within six months of the
time when the certificate is filed. (Education Code 44839, 44839.5; 5 CCR 5503)
Applicants and retirants shall pay for the cost of obtaining the medical certification. (Education Code 44849,
44839.5)
The Board may require a certificated employee or retirant to undergo a periodic medical examination by a physician
to determine that the employee is free from any communicable disease making him/her unfit to instruct or associate
with children. This periodic medical examination shall be at district expense. (Education Code 44839, 44839.5)
Mental Examination for Certificated Employees
A certificated employee may be suspended or transferred to other duties if the Board has reasonable cause to
believe that the employee is suffering from mental illness of such a degree as to render him/her incompetent to
perform his/her duties. In such a case, the district shall follow the process specified in Education Code 44942 and
the district's collective bargaining agreement, including the opportunity for the employee to be examined by a panel
of psychiatrists or psychologists.
