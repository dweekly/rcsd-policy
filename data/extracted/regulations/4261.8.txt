5. To care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness if the covered servicemember is the employee's
spouse, child, parent, or next of kin, as defined
In addition, the district shall grant PDL to any employee who is disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or other related medical
condition. (Government Code 12945; 2 CCR 11037)
Terms of Leave
An eligible employee shall be entitled to a total of 12 work weeks of FMLA or CFRA leave during any 12-month period,
except in the case of leave to care for a covered servicemember as provided under "Military Caregiver Leave" below. To the
extent allowed by law, CFRA and FMLA leaves shall run concurrently. In circumstances where the leaves do not run
concurrently under the law, the employee may take up to 12 work weeks for both CFRA and FMLA, for a total of 24 work
weeks. (Government Code 12945.2; 29 USC 2612).
This 12-month period shall be measured forward from the date the employee's first family care and medical leave begins. (29
CFR 825.200)
In addition, any employee who is disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or other related condition shall be entitled to PDL for the
period of the disability not to exceed four months. For a part-time employee, the four months shall be calculated on a
proportional basis. (Government Code 12945; 2 CCR 11042)
PDL shall run concurrently with FMLA leave for disability caused by an employee's pregnancy. At the end of the employee's
FMLA leave for disability caused by pregnancy, or at the end of four months of PDL, whichever occurs first, a CFRA-eligible
employee may request to take CFRA leave of up to 12 work weeks, for the reason of the birth of a child or to bond with or
care for the child. (Government Code 12945, 12945.2; 2 CCR 11046, 11093)
Leave taken for the birth or placement of a child must be concluded within the 12-month period beginning on the date of the
birth or placement of the child. Such leave does not need to be taken in one continuous period of time. (2 CCR 11090; 29
USC 2612)
Each eligible employee shall be granted up to 12 work weeks for family care and medical leave related to the birth or
placement of a child, regardless of whether both parents of the child work for the district.

Use/Substitution of Paid Leave
During any otherwise unpaid period of PDL or any FMLA or CFRA leave, the employee may elect to use accrued vacation
leave, or any other paid time off negotiated with the district that the employee is eligible to use. If the leave is for the
employee's own serious health condition or PDL, the employee may also elect to use accrued sick leave during the period of
leave. (Government Code 12945, 12945.2; 2 CCR 11044; 11092; 29 USC 2612)
The district and employee may also come to agreement regarding the use of any additional paid or unpaid time off instead of
using the employee's CFRA leave. (2 CCR 11092)
Intermittent Leave/Reduced Work or Leave Schedule
PDL and family care and medical leave for the serious health condition of an employee or eligible family member may be
taken intermittently or on a reduced work or leave schedule
when medically necessary, as determined by the health care provider of the person with the serious health condition.
However, the district shall limit leave increments to the shortest period of time that the district's payroll system uses to
account for absences or use of leave provided it is not to be greater than one hour. (Government Code 12945.2; 2 CCR
11042, 11090; 29 USC 2612)
The basic minimum duration of leave for the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child shall be two weeks. However,
the district shall grant a request for such leave of less than two weeks on any two occasions. (2 CCR 11090; 29 USC 2612)
The district may require an employee to transfer temporarily to an available alternative position under any of the following
circumstances: (2 CCR 11041, 11090; 29 USC 2612)
1. The employee needs intermiAent leave or leave on a reduced work schedule that is foreseeable based on a planned
medical treatment for the employee or family member.
 
2. A medical cer;ﬁca;on is provided by the employee's health care provider that, because of pregnancy, the employee
has a medical need to take intermittent leave or leave on a reduced work schedule.
 
3. The district agrees to permit intermiAent leave or leave on a reduced work schedule due to the birth, adop;on, or
foster care placement of the employee's child.
The alternative position must have equivalent pay and benefits and must better accommodate recurring periods of leave 
than the employee's regular job, and the employee must be qualified for the position. Transfer to an alternative position
may include altering an existing job to better accommodate the employee's need for intermittent leave or a reduced work or
leave schedule. (2 CCR 11041, 11090; 29 USC 2612)
Request for Leave
The district shall consider an employee's request for PDL or family care and medical leave only if the employee provides at
least verbal notice sufficient to make the district aware of the need to take the leave and the anticipated timing and duration
of the leave. (2 CCR 11050, 11091)
For family care and medical leave, the employee need not expressly assert or mention FMLA/CFRA to satisfy this
requirement. However, the employee must state the reason the leave is needed (e.g., birth of child, medical treatment). If
more information is necessary to determine whether the employee is eligible for family care and medical leave, the
Superintendent or designee shall inquire further and obtain the necessary details of the leave to be taken. (2 CCR 11091)
The district shall respond to requests for leave as soon as practicable, but no later than five business days after receiving the
employee's request. (2 CCR 11091)
Based on the information provided by the employee, the Superintendent or designee shall designate the leave, paid or unpaid,
as FMLA/CFRA qualifying leave and shall give notice of such designation to the employee. Failure of an employee to respond
to permissible inquiries regarding the leave request may result in denial of CFRA protection if the district is unable to
determine whether the leave is CFRA qualifying. (2 CCR 11091; 29 CFR 825.300)
When an employee is able to foresee the need for PDL or family care and medical leave at least 30 days in advance of the
leave, the employee shall provide the district with at least 30 days advance notice before the leave. When the 30 days' notice
is not practicable because of a lack of knowledge of when leave will be required to begin, a change in circumstances, a
medical emergency, or other good cause, the employee shall provide the district with notice as soon as practicable. Failure of
an employee to provide required notice may result in a denial of leave. (2 CCR 11050, 11091)

In all instances, the employee shall consult with the Superintendent or designee and make a reasonable effort to schedule,
subject to the health care provider's approval, any planned appointment or medical treatment or supervision so as to minimize
disruption to district operations. (Government Code 12945.2; 2 CCR 11050, 11091)
Certification of Health Condition
Within five business days of an employee's request for family care and medical leave for the serious health condition of the
employee or an eligible family member, the Superintendent or designee shall request that the employee provide certification
by a health care provider of the need for leave. Upon receiving the district's request, the employee shall provide the
certification within 15 calendar days, unless either the Superintendent or designee provides additional time or it is not
practicable under the particular circumstances, despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts. (2 CCR 11087, 11091; 29
CFR 825.305)
The certification shall include the following: (Government Code 12945.2; 2 CCR 11087; 29
USC 2613)
1. The date on which the serious health condition began
2. The probable duration of the condition
3. If the employee is reques;ng leave to care for an eligible family member with a serious health condi;on, both of the
following:
1. Statement that the serious health condi;on warrants the par;cipa;on of the employee to provide care, such as by
providing psychological comfort, arranging for third party care, or directly providing or par;cipa;ng in the medical
care of the eligible family member during a period of the treatment or supervision
1. Es;mated amount of ;me the health care provider believes the employee needs to care for the eligible family
member
4. If the employee is reques;ng leave because of the employee's own serious health condi;on, a statement that due to
the serious health condi;on, the employee is unable to work at all or is unable to perform one or more essen;al job
functions of the position
5. If the employee is reques;ng leave for intermiAent treatment or on a reduced work or leave schedule for planned
medical treatment, a statement of the medical necessity for the leave, the dates on which treatment is expected to be
given, the duration of such treatment, and the expected duration of the leave
The Superintendent or designee shall not request any genetic information related to an employee except as authorized by law
in accordance with the California Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2011. (Government Code 12940)
When an employee has provided sufficient medical certification to enable the district to determine whether the employee's
leave request is FMLA/CFRA-eligible, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the employee within five business days
whether the leave is FMLA/CFRA-eligible. The Superintendent or designee may also retroactively designate leave as
FMLA/CFRA leave as long as appropriate notice is given to the employee and there is no harm or injury to the employee. (2
CCR 11091; 29 CFR 825.301)
If the Superintendent or designee has a good faith objective reason to doubt the validity of a certification that accompanies a
request for leave for the employee's own serious health condition, the Superintendent or designee may require the employee
to obtain a second opinion from a district-approved health care provider, at district expense. If the second opinion is contrary
to the first, the Superintendent or designee may require the employee to obtain a third medical opinion from a third health
care provider approved by both the employee and the district, again at district expense. The opinion of the third health care
provider shall be final and binding. (Government Code 12945.2; 2 CCR 11091; 29 USC 2613)
Certification for PDL
The Superintendent or designee shall request that an employee who is requesting PDL provide certification by a health care
provider of the need for leave at the time the employee gives notice of the need for PDL, or within two business days of
giving the notice. If the need for PDL is unforeseen, the Superintendent or designee shall request the medical certification
within two business days after the leave commences. The Superintendent or designee may request certification at some later
date if the Superintendent or designee has reason to question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration. (2 CCR 11050)
For PDL that is foreseeable and for which at least 30 days' notice has been given, the employee shall provide the medical

certification before the leave begins. When this is not practicable, the employee shall provide the certification within the time
frame specified by the Superintendent or designee which must be at least 15 calendar days after the request, unless it is not
practicable under the particular circumstances despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts. (2 CCR 11050)
Medical certification for PDL purposes shall include a statement that the employee needs to take the leave because the
employee is disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition, the date on which the employee became
disabled because of pregnancy, and the estimated duration of the leave. (2 CCR 11050)
If additional PDL or family care and medical leave is needed when the time estimated by the health care provider expires, the
district may require the employee to provide recertification in the manner specified for the leave. (Government Code
12945.2; 2 CCR 11050; 29 USC 2613)
Release to Return to Work
Upon expiration of an employee's PDL or family care and medical leave taken for the employee's own serious health
condition, the employee shall present certification from the health care provider of the employee's ability to resume work.
The certification shall address the employee's ability to perform the essential job functions of the position.
Rights to Reinstatement
Upon granting an employee's request for PDL or FMLA/CFRA leave, the Superintendent or designee shall guarantee to
reinstate the employee in the same or a comparable position when the leave ends. (Government Code 12945.2; 2 CCR
11043, 11089; 29 USC 2614)
The district may refuse to reinstate an employee to the same or a comparable position if the FMLA/CFRA leave was
fraudulently obtained by the employee. (2 CCR 11089; 29 CFR 825.216)
The district may refuse to reinstate an employee to the same position after taking PDL if, at the time the reinstatement is
requested, the employee would not otherwise have been employed in that position for legitimate business reasons unrelated
to the employee's PDL. (2 CCR 11043)
Maintenance of Benefits/Failure to Return from Leave
During the period when an employee is on PDL or family care and medical leave, the employee shall maintain employee
status with the district and the leave shall not constitute a break in service for purposes of longevity, seniority under any
collective bargaining agreement, or any employee benefit plan. (Government Code 12945.2; 2 CCR 11092; 29
USC 2614)
For up to a maximum of four months for PDL and 12 work weeks for other family care and medical leave, the district shall
continue to provide an eligible employee the group health plan coverage that was in place before the employee took the
leave. The employee shall reimburse the district for premiums paid during the leave if the employee fails to return to district
employment after the expiration of all available leaves and the failure is for a reason other than the continuation, recurrence,
or onset of a serious health condition or other circumstances beyond the employee's control. (Government Code 12945.2; 2
CCR 11044, 11092; 29 USC 2614; 29 CFR 825.213)
In addition, during the period when an employee is on PDL or family care and medical leave, the employee shall be entitled to
continue to participate in other employee benefit plans including life insurance, short-term or long-term disability insurance,
accident insurance, pension and retirement plans, and supplemental unemployment benefit plans to the same extent and
under the same conditions as would apply to an unpaid leave taken for any other purpose. However, for purposes of pension
and retirement plans, the district shall not make plan payments for an employee during any unpaid portion of the leave period
and the leave period shall not be counted for purposes of time accrued under the plan. (Government Code 12945.2; 2 CCR
11044, 11092)

An employee who is requesting leave for qualifying exigencies shall provide the Superintendent or designee with a copy of
the military member's active duty orders, or other documentation issued by the military, and the dates of the service. In
