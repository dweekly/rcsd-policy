Each principal or designee shall establish emergency procedures, rules for student conduct, and school rules for the
safe and appropriate use of school facilities, equipment, and materials consistent with law, board policy, and
administrative regulation. The rules shall be communicated to students, distributed to parents/guardians and shall be
readily available at the school at all times.
Release of Students 
Students shall be released during the school day only to the custody of an adult who is one of the following:
1. The student's custodial parent/guardian. 
 
2. An adult authorized on the student's emergency card as an individual to whom the student may be released
when the custodial parent/guardian cannot be reached, provided the principal or designee verifies the adult's
identity. 
 
3. An authorized law enforcement officer acting in accordance with law. 
 
4. An adult taking the student to emergency medical care at the request of the principal or designee. 
Supervision of Students 
Teachers shall be present at their respective rooms and shall open them to admit students not less than 15 minutes
before the time when school starts. (5 CCR 5570) 
Every teacher shall hold students accountable for their conduct on the way to and from school, on the playgrounds,
and during recess. (Education Code 44807) 
The principal or designee shall require all individuals supervising students to remain alert for unauthorized persons
and dangerous conditions, promptly report any such observations to the principal or designee, and file a written
report as appropriate. 
Any certificated or classified employee, or other school official, whose duties bring the employee or other school
official in contact on a regular basis with students in any of grades 6-12, as part of a middle of high school, who are
alerted to or observe any threat or perceived threat of a homicidal act, as defined, shall immediately report the threat
or perceived threat to law enforcement in accordance with Education Code 49393. (Education Code 49390, 49393) 
Threat or perceived threat means any writing or action of a student that creates a reasonable suspicion that the
student is preparing to commit a homicidal act related to school or a school activity. This may include possession,
use, or depictions of firearms, ammunition, shootings, or targets in association with infliction of physical harm,
destruction, or death in a social media post, journal, class note, or other media associated with the student. It may
also include a warning by a parent, student, or other individual. 
Additionally, anyone who receives or learns of a health or safety threat related to school or a school activity is
encouraged to report the threat to a school or district administrator. 
In arranging for appropriate supervision on playgrounds, the principal or designee shall: 
1. Clearly identify supervision zones on the playground and require all playground supervisors to remain outside
at a location from which they can observe their entire zone of supervision 
 
2. Consider the size of the playground area, the number of areas that are not immediately visible, and the age of
the students to determine the ratio of playground supervisors to students 
At any school where playground supervision is not otherwise provided, the principal or designee shall provide for
certificated employees to supervise the conduct and safety, and direct the play, of students who are on school
grounds before and after school and during recess and other intermissions (5 CCR 5552) 
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that teachers, teacher aides, playground supervisors, yard aides, and


volunteers who supervise students receive training in safety practices and in supervisory techniques that will help
them to forestall problems and resolve conflicts among students. Additionally, all staff and other school officials shall
be made aware of their responsibilities regarding the reporting of potential homicidal acts to law enforcement, and
receive training in the assessment and reporting of such threats. The training shall be documented and kept on file. 
Student Safety Patrols 
A school safety patrol shall be composed of students of the school who are selected by the principal and shall be
allowed to serve only with written consent of the student and their parent/guardian. Patrol members shall be at least
10 years old and in the fifth grade. (Education Code 49302; 5 CCR 571)
School safety patrols shall be used only at those locations where the nature of traffic will permit their safe operation.
The locations where school safety patrols are used should be determined jointly with the local law enforcement
agency. (5 CCR 572) 
Patrol members shall be under the supervision and control of the principal or designee and shall receive training in
proper procedures, including, but not limited to, the operations specified in 5 CCR 573-574. Whenever on duty,
patrol members shall wear the standard uniform required by 5 CCR 576.
Playground Safety 
Any new playground or any replacement of equipment or modification of components inside an existing playground
shall conform to standards set forth by the American Society for Testing and Materials and the guidelines set forth by
the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. The Superintendent or designee shall have a playground safety
inspector certified by the National Playground Safety Institute conduct an initial inspection to aid compliance with
applicable safety standards. (Health and Safety Code 115725)
Activities with Safety Risks 
Due to concerns about the risk to student safety, the principal or designee shall not permit the following activities on
campus or during school-sponsored events unless the activity is properly supervised, students wear protective gear

any such bicycle, scooter, skateboard, or roller skates at school shall wear a properly fitted and fastened bicycle
helmet. 
Laboratory Safety 
The principal of each school offering laboratory work shall develop procedures for laboratory safety and designate a
trained certificated employee to implement and regularly review, update, and implement these procedures.

students ways to protect their hearing.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide schools with eye safety devices for use whenever students, teachers,
or visitors are engaged in or observing an activity or using hazardous substances likely to cause injury to the eyes.
