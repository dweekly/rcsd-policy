The principal or designee shall require all individuals supervising students to remain alert for unauthorized persons
and dangerous conditions, promptly report any such observations to the principal or designee, and file a written
report as appropriate. 
Any certificated or classified employee, or other school official, whose duties bring the employee or other school

encouraged to report the threat to a school or district administrator.

1. Clearly identify supervision zones on the playground and require all playground supervisors to remain outside
at a location from which they can observe their entire zone of supervision 
 
2. Consider the size of the playground area, the number of areas that are not immediately visible, and the age of
the students to determine the ratio of playground supervisors to students 
At any school where playground supervision is not otherwise provided, the principal or designee shall provide for
certificated employees to supervise the conduct and safety, and direct the play, of students who are on school
grounds before and after school and during recess and other intermissions (5 CCR 5552)
