Before an intern enrolls in any college or university program to renew his/her internship credential, the

(Education Code 44457)
District Internship Program
Persons employed through the district internship program may be assigned to teach in any classes in grades K-12, in

(Education Code 44830.3)
Each district intern shall be assisted and guided by either of the following: (Education Code 44326, 44830.3)

the district intern he/she serves, and who is selected through a competitive process adopted by the Board of
Education after consultation with the exclusive teacher representative unit
 
2. Personnel employed by a college or university to supervise student teachers
The Superintendent or designee shall, in consultation with a college or university, develop and implement a
professional development plan for district interns. This plan shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the
components described in Education Code 44830.3, including provisions for mandatory preservice training tailored to
the grade level or class to be taught, additional instruction during the first year of service when required, and an
annual evaluation of the district intern. (Education Code 44830.3)
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that appropriate records are maintained, showing the credit earned by

When a district intern has successfully completed service sufficient to meet program standards and performance
assessments, the Board may recommend to the CTC that the intern be awarded a preliminary credential. The Board
may recommend issuance of a professional clear credential if the program includes an approved induction plan or
CTC-approved advanced coursework meeting the requirements of Education Code 44259(c) for a professional clear
credential. (Education Code 44328, 44468, 44830.3)
Early Completion Option
An intern may choose an early completion option leading to a five-year preliminary credential by completing the
following requirements: (Education Code 44468)
1. Passing the CTC-approved assessment of knowledge of teaching foundations
 
2. Passing the CTC-approved teaching performance assessment
 
a. The intern shall first pass the assessment of teaching foundations described in item #1 before qualifying
to take the teaching performance assessment.



b. The intern may take the teaching performance assessment only one time as part of the early completion
option. An intern who is not successful on this assessment may complete his/her internship program and
his/her scores shall be used to provide an individualized professional development plan that emphasizes
preparation in areas where additional growth is warranted and waiving preparation in areas where the
intern has demonstrated competence.
The intern must retake and pass the teaching performance assessment at the end of the internship in
order to be considered for recommendation to the CTC.
 
3. For interns pursuing a preliminary multiple subjects credential, passing the reading instruction competence
assessment described in Education Code 44283
