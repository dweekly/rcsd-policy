Proposition 39 was approved by California voters in the November 7, 2000, general election and provides
that the governing board of a school district may pursue the authorization and issuance of general obligation
bonds by 55 percent vote of the electorate. As a result of the passage of Proposition 39, language was added
to the Education Code requiring school districts passing a bond designated as a Proposition 39 bond to
establish a citizens’ oversight committee (“Committee”) to actively review and report to the public on uses of
bond proceeds to ensure that they are spent only on permissible purposes. In order to comply with these
requirements, the District’s Board of Trustees shall establish a Committee within sixty (60) days of the date
that the Board enters election results of a successful Proposition 39 general election bond measure in its
minutes.
A. Committee’s Purpose
The purpose of the Committee is to inform the public concerning the expenditure and uses of bond
revenues. The Committee’s legal charge is to actively review and report on the expenditure of taxpayer’s
money for school construction. The Committee shall convene to provide oversight of the following:
1. That bond revenues from Proposition 39 bonds adopted by a 55 percent vote of the electorate are
expended only for the purpose described in Article 13A, section 1, subdivision (b)(3) of the California
Constitution including the construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation or replacement of school
facilities, including the furnishing and equipping of school facilities, or the acquisition or lease of real
property for school facilities; and
 
2. That, for Proposition 39 bonds adopted by a 55 percent vote of the electorate, as prohibited by Article
13A, section 1, subdivision (b)(3)(A) of the California Constitution, no funds are used for any teacher
and administrative salaries or other school operating expenses normally paid from the general fund;
although salaries for personnel assigned to the bond program are allowable as described in applicable
case law.
B. Committee’s Duties
The Committee may engage in the following activities in furtherance of its purpose:
1. Receiving and reviewing copies of the annual performance audits required by Article 13A, section 1,
subdivision (b)(3)(C) of the California Constitution.
 
2. Receiving and reviewing the annual financial audits required by Article 13A, section 1, subdivision (b)(3)
(C) of the California Constitution.
 
3. Inspecting school facilities and grounds to ensure that bond revenues are expended in compliance with
the requirements of Article 13A, section 1, subdivision (b)(3) of the California Constitution.
 
4. Receiving and reviewing copies of any deferred maintenance proposals or plans developed by the
District, including any reports required by Education Code section 17584.1.
 
5. Reviewing efforts by the District to maximize bond revenues by implementing cost-saving measures
including, but not limited, to the following:
 
a. mechanisms designed to reduce the costs of professional fees;
 
b. mechanisms designed to reduce the cost of site preparation;
 
c. recommendations regarding the joint use of core facilities;
 
d. mechanisms designed to reduce costs by incorporating efficiencies in school site design; and
 


e. recommendations regarding the use of cost-effective and efficient reusable facility plans.
C. Committee Operations
The Committee’s legal charge is to review bond expenditures and to inform the public about the uses of
bond proceeds. The Committee’s purpose is an audit function rather than ad advisory function. The
Committee shall not have the authority to:
1. Participate in the bond sale and issuance process or make decisions concerning the timing, terms or
structure of a bond issuance, except that the Committee may review the District’s bond issuance
documents upon the conclusion of a bond sale if desired.
 
2. Determine how bond funds shall be spent.
 
3. Select contractors or consultants for bond projects or participate in the negotiation or bid process for
such contractors and consultants.
 
4. Enter or inspect a job site or construction project without prior permission of the District
Superintendent or designee. Frequency and timing of all such visits are within the sole discretion of the
Superintendent or designee. Visits to job sites require that the Committee member(s) be accompanied
by a representative of the District and require that all safety measures in effect at the job site be
followed.
 
5. Contact District contractors or consultants, including without limitation, accountants, auditors,
architects, financial advisors and legal counsel, without the prior permission of the District
Superintendent or designee.
 
6. Require the District to prepare reports or conduct audits more frequently than those required by law.
The Committee shall not be entitled to legal representation by District legal counsel or at
District expense, unless permitted by the Board.
The Committee shall meet in accordance with a regular schedule, the dates of which shall be determined by
the Committee. In its first year, the Committee shall meet no more than quarterly; thereafter, the Committee
shall meet at least once per year. Committee members shall be available to attend Board meetings when
performance and financial audits are presented. The Superintendent or his/her designee shall act as staff to
the Committee and attend Committee meetings. Members of the Board may attend as necessary or
desirable. The Chair shall call the roll of the Committee members at the beginning of each meeting. Each
Committee member shall sign an attendance sheet that shall be maintained by the person designated by the
Chair.
The Committee’s meetings are subject to the Ralph M. Brown Act, Government Code section 54950 et seq.
Meetings shall be open to the public and noticed in the same manner as proceedings of the Board. An action
item on the agenda may be approved by a simple majority of Committee members in attendance, a quorum
being present.
The Committee shall annually select a Chair and a Vice-Chair and other officers as it determines, each for a
one (1)-year term that may be renewed as determined by the Committee. District staff shall keep minutes of
each Committee meeting. The minutes shall be distributed to each Committee member, and the Board, if
requested, at the earliest reasonable date prior to the next subsequent meeting. Minutes of Committee
proceedings and all documents received and reports issued shall be a matter of public record. The
Committee shall submit all documents and minutes to the District’s webmaster for publication on the
District’s internet website for public and community information services.
The Committee shall prepare regular reports on its activities. A report shall be issued at least once each year
summarizing its review of the District’s bond program for the past year. Upon completion of all bond
projects, the Committee shall prepare a final written report summarizing its activities and conclusions.
The Board shall, without expending bond funds:

1. Provide the Committee with any necessary technical assistance;
 
2. Provide administrative assistance in furtherance of the Committee’s purpose; and
 
3. Provide the Committee with sufficient resources to publicize the Committee’sconclusions.
The District may appoint District staff and consultants to serve as a resource to the Committee as needed to
assist the Committee in carrying out its duties.
By Committee vote at any of its regular meetings, the Committee may form sub-committees for specific
tasks. The Committee shall elect a chair of each sub-committee and provide written assignment goals for
each subcommittee. Sub-committees may be subject to the Ralph M. Brown Act, pursuant to Government
Code section 54952, subdivision (b).
D. Committee Selection and Composition
The Committee shall be comprised of individuals who either live or work within the boundaries of the school
district. The Superintendent or designee shall solicit applications for membership on the Committee, and in
the event the number of applicants exceeds the number of spaces available, shall conduct interviews of
interested and qualified citizens and make recommendations to the Board for appointments. The Board shall
have the authority at its sole discretion to select and appoint the Committee, including the filling of vacancies
that may occur during a member’s term. While the Committee must consist of at least seven (7) members,
the Board shall determine the final size of the Committee.
As required by law, Committee membership shall include the following categories:
1. One (1) member shall be active in a business organization representing the business community located
within the school district;
 
2. One (1) member shall be active in a senior citizens’ organization;
 
3. One (1) member shall be active in a bona fide taxpayers’ organization;
 
4. One (1) member shall be the parent or guardian of at least one child currently enrolled in a school of
the District; and
 
5. One (1) member shall be both a parent or guardian of at least one child currently enrolled in a school of
the District and be an active member in a District parent/teacher organization, such as the PTA or
schoolsite council.
No employee or official of the District shall be appointed to the Committee. Additionally, no vendor,
contractor, or consultant of the District shall be appointed to the Committee. Members of the Committee
shall, pursuant to Education Code section 35233 and 72533, abide by the prohibitions contained in Article 4
(commencing with Section 1090) and Article 4.7 (commencing with Section 1125) of Division 4 of Title 1 of
the Government Code. Committee members who wish to be appointed for a second or third two (2) or three
(3) -year term shall reapply to the Board for consideration. Committee members shall receive no
remuneration for their participation on the Committee.
E. Replacing a Committee Member
Members should attend regularly scheduled meetings. Members are expected to share responsibilities for
carrying out the work of the Committee and abide by Board policies and administrative regulations. The
Committee will advise a Committee member in writing that he/she is in violation of Committee participation
requirements if the Committee member fails to attend two consecutive regularly scheduled meetings
without an acceptable reason announced in advance. A new Committee member will be named by the Board
if one or more of the following events occurs:
1. The Committee member submits a written resignation; or
 


2. The Committee member misses two (2) consecutive Committee meetings without an acceptable reason
announced in advance.
An individual who replaces such a member shall serve until the completion of the original member’s term.
Thereafter, the member must apply for an additional term if she/he wishes to remain on the Committee. A
member who is replaced may appeal to the Board for the Board to reappoint that person to the Committee.
A Committee member who no longer serves as a representative of the designated group she/he was
appointed to represent (e.g., ceases to be active within a taxpayers’ organization, or ceases to
have a child enrolled in the District) shall be allowed to complete his/her term. However, that Committee
member shall not be entitled to serve a subsequent term as a representative of the designated group.
Within sixty (60) days of being notified of a Committee vacancy, the Board will appoint a new member to
complete the term of the vacancy following the process used to select the original
Committee members. Committee members shall be subject to prohibitions regarding incompatibility of office
pursuant to Government Code sections 1125-1129 and financial interest in contracts pursuant to
Government Code sections 1090-1099.
