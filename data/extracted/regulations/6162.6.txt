Each employee making a reproduction shall first determine whether the copying is permitted by law based on the
guidelines below. If the copying is not permitted according to these guidelines, the principal/designee may request
permission to reproduce the material from its copyright holders.
Requests for permission to use copyrighted materials shall include the following information:
1. Title, author(s), editor(s) or publisher, producer(s) or distributor.
 
2. Edition, copyright and/or production year.
 
3. Exact amount of material to be used (i.e., lines, pages, running time, etc.).
 
4. Nature of the use (i.e., how many times, when and with whom the material will be used).
 
5. Number of copies to be made.
 
6. How the material will be reproduced.
 
7. If an initial contact was made by phone, the request shall also include the name of the initial contact person.
The following guidelines differentiate between permitted and prohibited uses of printed material, sheet and recorded
music, videotapes, films, filmstrips or slide programs, off-air taping (radio or television), and computer software.
Printed Materials
Permitted Uses:
1. Single copies at the request of an individual teacher:
 
a. A chapter of a book.
 
b. An article from a magazine or newspaper.
 
c. A short story, short essay or short poem, whether or not from a collective work.
 
d. A chart, graph, diagram, drawing, cartoon or a picture from a book, magazine or newspaper.
 
2. Multiple copies at the request of an individual teacher for classroom use, not to exceed one copy per student
in a course:

is less, but in any event a minimum of 500 words.
 
e. One chart, graph, diagram, cartoon or picture per book or magazine issue.
All preceding copies must bear the copyright notice. They may be made only at the discretion of the individual
teacher on occasions when a delay to request permission would preclude their most effective instructional use.
Prohibited Uses:
1. Copying more than one work or two excerpts from a single author during one class term.
 


2. Copying more than three works from a collective work or periodical volume during one class term.
 
3. Copying materials for more than one course in the school where the copies are made.
 
4. More than nine sets of multiple copies for distribution to students in one class term.
 
5. Copying used to create, replace or substitute for anthologies or collective works.
 
6. Copying of "consumable" works such as workbooks, standardized tests, answer sheets, etc.
 
7. Copying that substitutes for the purchase of books, publishers' reprints or periodicals.
 
8. Repeated copying of the same item by the same teacher from term to term.
The above prohibitions do not apply to current news magazines and newspapers.
Sheet and Recorded Music
Permitted Uses:
1. Emergency copies for an imminent performance are permitted, provided they are replacing purchased copies
and replacement is planned.
 
2. Multiple copies (one per student) of excerpts not constituting an entire performable unit or more than 10% of
the total work may be made for academic purposes other than performances.
 
3. Purchased sheet music may be edited or simplified provided the character of the work is not distorted or lyrics
added or altered.
 
4. A single copy of a recorded performance by students may be retained by the district or individual teacher for
evaluation or rehearsal purposes.
 
5. A single copy of recordings of copyrighted music owned by the district or individual teacher may be made and
retained for the purpose of constructing exercises or examinations.
 
6. A single copy of an excerpt that constitutes an entire performable unit (i.e., a movement or aria) may be made,
provided it is either:
 
a. Confirmed by the copyright proprietor to be out of print, or
 
b. Unavailable except in a larger work. This may be done by or for a teacher only for scholarly research or
in preparation for teaching a class.
 
7. A single copy of a portion of a sound recording may be made by or for a student, i.e., a song from a record, but
not the entire recording. The copy may be used in the educational context in which it was made and may not
be sold or performed for profit.
Prohibited Uses:
1. Copying to replace or substitute for anthologies or collections.
 
2. Copying from works intended to be "consumable."
 
3. Copying for purposes of performance except as noted in an emergency.
 
4. Copying to substitute for purchase of music.
 
5. Copying without inclusion of copyright notice on the copy.
 
6. Duplication of tapes, unless reproduction rights were given at time of purchase.

Videotapes, Films, Visual Media or Slide Programs
Permitted Uses:
1. A single copy of a portion of a copyrighted film or visual media may be made by a student for educational
purposes if the material is owned by the school which the student attends.
 
2. A single copy of a small portion of a film or visual media may be made by or for a teacher for scholarly or
teaching purposes.
 
3. Selected slides may be reproduced from a series if reproduction does not exceed 10% of the total or excerpt
the essence of the work.
 
4. A slide or overhead transparency series may be created from multiple sources as long as creation does not
exceed 10% of photographs in one source (book, magazine, filmstrip, etc.). This may not be done when the
source forbids photographic reproduction.
 
5. A single overhead transparency may be created from a single page of a "consumable" workbook.
 
6. Sections of a film may be excerpted for a local videotape (not to be shown over cable) if they do not exceed
10% of the total or excerpt the essence of the work. Extreme care must be exercised in copying a small
portion of a film or filmstrip; small portions may contain the very essence of the material in question.
Prohibited Uses:
1. Reproduction of an audiovisual work in its entirety.
 
2. Conversion from one media format to another, e.g., film to videotape, unless permission is secured.
 
3. No one is permitted to copy any portion of a film or filmstrip sent to the school for preview or rented or
owned by another school or institution without the express written permission of the copyright holder. The
copyright of a film governs its performance (showing) as well as the copying of it. It is permissible to show a
film to students using closed-circuit television if the system is confined to one building. Showing a film via
closed-circuit television outside the building is not permitted.
Radio - Off-Air Taping
Permitted Uses:
1. A single copy of a small portion of a copyrighted radio program may be made by a student for educational
purposes. Such a copy may not be sold or performed for profit.
 
2. Copies of broadcasts by national public radio may be made by district employees and retained for an indefinite
period for educational purposes.
Prohibited Uses:
Copying broadcasts on commercial radio, except for copyrighted musical selections (see Sheet and Recorded Music),
is governed by the same copyright laws that apply to off-air taping of commercial television; however, there is no
special provision allowing libraries to tape radio news programs.
Television - Off-Air Taping
Permitted Uses:
1. A broadcast program may be recorded off-air simultaneously with broadcast transmission (including
simultaneous cable retransmission) and retained for a period not to exceed 45 days. All off-air recordings shall
be erased or destroyed at the end of the retention period. Broadcast programs are television programs
transmitted for reception by the general public without charge.
 
2. Off-air recordings may be used once by individual teachers in the course of relevant teaching activities and
repeated once only when instructional reinforcement is necessary. These recordings may be shown in
classrooms and similar places devoted to instruction within a single building, cluster, or campus, as well as in

the homes of students receiving formalized home instruction, during the first 10 consecutive school days in the
45 calendar-day retention period.
 
3. Off-air recordings may be made only at the request of individual teachers, for use by those teachers. No
broadcast program may be recorded off-air more than once at the request of the same teacher, regardless of
the number of times the program may be broadcast.
 
4. A limited number of copies may be reproduced from each off-air recording to meet the legitimate needs of
teachers under these guidelines. Each such additional copy shall be subject to all provisions governing the
original recording.
 
5. After the first 10 consecutive school days, off-air recordings may be used up to the end of the 45 calendar day
retention period only for teacher evaluation purposes; i.e., to determine whether or not to include the
broadcast program in the teaching curriculum; they may not be used for student exhibition or any other
nonevaluation purpose without authorization.
 
6. All copies of off-air recordings shall include the copyright notice on the broadcast programs as recorded.
Prohibited Uses:
1. Off-air recording in anticipation of teacher requests.
 
2. Using the recording for instruction after the 10-day use period.
 
3. Holding the recording for weeks or indefinitely because:
 
a. Units needing the program concepts are not taught within the 10-day use period.
 
b. An interruption or technical problems delayed its use.
 
c. Another teacher wishes to use it, or for any other supposedly "legitimate" educational reason.
 
4. On occasion a special notice is provided with some materials specifically prohibiting reproduction of any kind.
Permission to use any part of such works must be secured in writing from the author or producer in
accordance with this regulation.
 
5. Off-air recordings need not be used in their entirety, but the content of recorded programs may not be altered.
Off-air recordings may not be physically or electronically combined or merged to constitute teaching
anthologies or compilations.
Software Copyright
Permitted Uses:
Except as permitted by license agreement, copies of district-owned software may be made only when:
1. The copy is needed as an essential step in using the computer program with a particular machine. This copy is
to be used in no other way.
 
2. The copy is used for archival or "backup" purposes. This copy may be held only as a file copy and must be
destroyed when the program is no longer rightfully owned by the district unless the copyright owner
authorizes its sale, lease or transfer as part of the sale, lease or transfer of the original program. (United States
Code, Title 17, Section 117).
Prohibited Uses:
1. Copies of copyrighted programs may not be made for any purpose other than the two permitted above.
 
2. When permission is obtained from the copyright holder to use software on a disk-sharing system, efforts will
be made to secure software from copying.
 
3. Illegal copies of copyrighted programs shall not be made or used on school equipment.
