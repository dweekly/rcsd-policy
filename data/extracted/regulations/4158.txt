An employee may use reasonable and necessary force when necessary for self-defense, to protect another person or
property, to quell a disturbance threatening physical injury to others, or to obtain possession of weapons or other
dangerous objects on or within the control of a student. (Education Code 44807, 49001)
Employees shall promptly report to their principal or other immediate supervisor any attack, assault or physical
threat made against them by anyone.
Both the employee and the principal or other immediate supervisor shall promptly report such instances to the
appropriate local law enforcement agency. (Education Code 44014)
In addition, employees are encouraged to promptly report to their principal or supervisor, and may report to law
enforcement, any attack, assault or threat made against them on school grounds by any other individual.
Reports of attack, assault or threat also shall be forwarded immediately to the Superintendent or designee.
An employee whose person or property is injured or damaged by willful misconduct of a student may ask the district
to pursue legal action against the student or the student's parent/guardian. (Education Code 48905)
Notice Regarding Student Offenses Committed While Under School Jurisdiction
The Superintendent or designee shall inform the teacher of each student who has engaged in, or is reasonably
suspected of, any act during the previous three school years which could constitute grounds for suspension or
expulsion under Education Code 48900, with the exception of the possession or use of tobacco products, or
Education Code 48900.2, 48900.3, 48900.4, or 48900.7. This information shall be based upon district records
maintained in the ordinary course of business or records received from a law enforcement agency. (Education Code
49079)
Upon receiving a transfer student's record regarding acts committed by the student that resulted in his/her
suspension or expulsion, the Superintendent or designee shall inform any of the student's teacher(s) that the student
was suspended from his/her former district and of the act that resulted in the suspension or expulsion. (Education
Code 48201)
Information received by teacher(s) shall be received in confidence for the limited purpose for which it was provided
and shall not be further disseminated by the teacher. (Education Code 49079)
Notice Regarding Student Offenses Committed While Outside School Jurisdiction
When informed by the court that a minor student has been found by a court to have committed any felony or any
misdemeanor involving curfew, gambling, alcohol, drugs, tobacco products, carrying of weapons, a sex offense listed
in Penal Code 290, assault or battery, larceny, vandalism or graffiti, the Superintendent or designee shall so inform
the school principal. (Welfare and Institution Code 827)
The principal shall disseminate this information to the counselor(s) who directly supervises or reports on the
student's behavior or progress. The principal also may inform any teacher or administrator he/she thinks may need
the information so as to work with the student appropriately, avoid being needlessly vulnerable, or protect others
from vulnerability. (Welfare and Institutions Code 827)
Any court-initiated information that a teacher, counselor or administrator receives shall be kept confidential and used
only to rehabilitate the student and protect other students and staff. The information shall be further disseminated
only when communication with the student, parent/guardian, law enforcement staff and probation officer is
necessary to rehabilitate the student or to protect students and staff. (Welfare and Institutions Code 827)
When a student is removed from school as a result of his/her offense, the Superintendent shall hold the court's
information in a separate confidential file until the student is returned to public school. If the student is returned to a
different district, the Superintendent shall transmit the information provided by the student's parole or probation
officer to the Superintendent of the new district of attendance. (Welfare and Institutions Code 827)
Any confidential file of court-initiated information shall be kept until the student becomes 18, graduates from high
school, or is released from juvenile court jurisdiction, whichever occurs first; it shall then be destroyed. (Welfare and



Institutions Code 827)
Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality of Student Offenses
In order to maintain confidentiality when providing information about student offenses to counselors and teachers of
classes/programs to which a student is assigned, the principal or designee shall send the staff member a written
notification requesting him/her to review a student's file in the school office as soon as practicable. This notification
shall not name or otherwise identify the student. The staff member shall be asked to initial the notification and return
it to the principal or designee.
The staff member shall also initial the student's file when reviewing it in the school office. Once the district has made
a good faith effort to comply with the notification requirement of Education Code 49079 and Welfare and
Institutions Code 827, an employee's failure to review the file constitutes district compliance with the requirement
to provide notice to the teacher.
