2. If only two grade levels are reduced at a school, the grade levels shall be grades 1 and 2.
 
3. If three grade levels are reduced at a school, then those grade levels shall be kindergarten and grades 1 and 2
or grades 1 through 3. Priority shall be given to the reduction of class sizes in grades 1 and 2 before class sizes
of kindergarten or grade 3 are reduced.

priority shall be given to the reduction of class sizes in grade 1 and 2; second priority shall be given to the
reduction of class size in kindergarten and grade 3.
