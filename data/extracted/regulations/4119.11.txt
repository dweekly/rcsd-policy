Definitions
Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to, unwelcome sexual advances, unwanted requests for sexual favors, or other

educational setting under any of the following conditions:
1. Submission to the conduct is made explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of the individual's employment.
 
2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by the individual is used as the basis for an employment decision affecting
the individual.
 
3. The conduct has the purpose or effect of having a negative impact upon the individual's work performance or has the
purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.
 
4. Submission to or rejection of the conduct by the other individual is used as the basis for any decision affecting the
individual regarding benefits, services, honors, programs, or activities available at or through the district.

harassment is defined as any of the following forms of conduct that occurs in an education program or activity in which a

1. A district employee conditioning the provision of a district aid, benefit, or service on the person's participation

effectively denies a person equal access to the district's education program or activity
 
3. Sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking as defined in 20 USC 1092 or 34 USC 12291

requires the use of independent judgment.
Such training may be completed by employees individually or as part of a group presentation, may be completed in shorter
segments as long as the applicable hourly requirement is met, and may be provided in conjunction with other training
provided to the employees. The training shall be presented by trainers or educators with knowledge and expertise in the

the detrimental consequences of this conduct on employee productivity and morale, and that a single act does not
constitute abusive conduct unless the act is severe or egregious
The Superintendent or designee shall retain for at least two years the records of any training provided to supervisory
