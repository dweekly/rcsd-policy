The Superintendent or designee shall annually provide the Board, at a public meeting, information and related
actuarial reports showing the estimated accrued but unfunded cost of workers' compensation claims. The Board shall
disclose, as a separate agenda item, whether or not it will reserve in the budget sufficient amounts to fund the
present value of these claims or if it is otherwise decreasing the amount in its workers' compensation reserve fund.
The Board shall annually certify to the County Superintendent the amount, if any, that it has decided to reserve in
the budget for these costs. The Board shall submit to the County Superintendent any budget revisions that may be
necessary to account for this budget reserve. (Education Code 42141)
