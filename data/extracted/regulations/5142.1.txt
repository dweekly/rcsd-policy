transfers into the school. (Education Code 49068.5)
If a school receives notice from a law enforcement agency that a child enrolled in that school has been reported
missing, the principal or designee shall place a notice that the child has been reported missing on the front of the
child's school record. If a school receives a record inquiry or request from any person or entity regarding a missing
child about whom the school has been notified, the principal or designee shall immediately notify the law
enforcement authorities who informed the school of the missing child's status. (Education Code 49068.6)
Fingerprinting Program
At the time of students' enrollment in the district, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the parents/guardians

writing that they may reverse their declaration on fingerprinting in writing at any time. (Education Code 32390)

at any parent-teacher conference. No report or document containing a student's fingerprints shall be kept by the
district or given to any other private or public entity. (Education Code 32390)
