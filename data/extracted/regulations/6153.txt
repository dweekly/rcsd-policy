Supervision
Students on school-sponsored trips are under the jurisdiction of the district and shall be subject to district and school 
rules and regulations.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that adequate supervision is provided on all school-sponsored trips and that

ratio shall be revised as necessary.
Parent/Guardian Permission
Before a student can participate in a school-sponsored trip, the teacher shall obtain parent/guardian permission for the 
trip. Whenever a trip involves water activities, the parent/guardian shall provide specific permission for his/her child to 
participate in the water activities. The district shall provide an alternative educational experience for students whose 
parents/guardians do not wish them to participate in a trip.
All persons making the field trip or excursion shall be deemed to have waived all claims against the district or the State 
of California for injury, accident, illness, or death occurring during or by reason of the field trip or excursion. All adults

excursions shall sign a statement waiving such claims. (Education Code 35330)
