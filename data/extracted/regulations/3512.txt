District equipment shall be used primarily for educational purposes and/or to conduct district business. The
Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all employees, students, and other users understand the appropriate
use of district equipment and that any misuse may be cause for disciplinary action or loss of user privilege.
The district shall provide comparable basic equipment and supplies for all classes. When equipment cannot be
supplied to every class, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that it will be shared within and among the
schools.
School-connected organizations may be granted reasonable use of the equipment for school-related matters as long
as it does not interfere with the use by students or employees or otherwise disrupt district operations.
Transfer of Equipment to a New Site
The Superintendent or designee shall approve the transfer of any district equipment from one work site to another
and the removal of any district equipment for off-site use. When any equipment is taken off site, the borrower is
responsible for its safe return and shall be fully liable for any loss or damage.
Employees transferred to another school shall take with them only those personal items that have been purchased
with their own funds unless otherwise authorized by the Superintendent or designee or applicable Board policy.
The Superintendent or designee shall maintain an inventory of all equipment currently valued in excess of $500. 
(Education Code 35168; 5 CCR 3946)
When equipment is unusable or is no longer needed, it may be sold, donated, or disposed of in accordance with
Education Code 17540-17555 or 2 CFR 200.313, as applicable.
Equipment Acquired by Federal Funds
The Superintendent or designee shall obtain prior written approval from the California Department of Education or
other awarding agency before purchasing equipment with federal funds. (2 CFR 200.48, 200.313, 200.439)
Equipment purchased for use in a federal program shall be used in that program as long as needed, whether or not
the program continues to be supported by federal funds. The equipment may be used in other activities currently or
previously supported by a federal agency when such use does not interfere with the work on the project or program
for which it was originally acquired or when use of the equipment is no longer needed for the original program. (2
CFR 200.313)
All equipment purchased with Consolidated Application funds shall be labeled with the name of the project,
identification number and name of the district. (2 CFR 200.313; 5 CCR 3946)
