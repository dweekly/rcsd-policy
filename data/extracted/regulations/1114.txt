Definitions
Social media means any online platform for collaboration, interaction, and active participation, including, but not
limited to, social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, or blogs.
Official district social media platform is a site authorized by the Superintendent or designee. Sites that have not been
authorized by the Superintendent or designee but that contain content related to the district or comments on district
operations, such as a site created by a parent-teacher organization, booster club, or other school-connected
organization or a student's or employee's personal site, are not considered official district social media platforms.
Authorization for Official District Social Media Platforms
The Superintendent or designee shall authorize the development of any official district social media platform.
Teachers and coaches shall obtain approval from the principal before creating an official classroom or team social
media platform.
Guidelines for Content
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that official district social media platforms provide current information
regarding district programs, activities, and operations, consistent with the goals and purposes of this policy and
regulation. Official district social media platforms shall contain content that is appropriate for all audiences.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that copyright laws are not violated in the use of material on official
district social media platforms.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that official district social media platforms are regularly monitored. Staff
members responsible for monitoring content may remove posts based on viewpoint-neutral considerations, such as
lack of relation to the site's purpose or violation of the district's policy, regulation, or content guidelines.
Each official district social media platform shall prominently display:
1. The purpose of the site along with a statement that users are expected to use the site only for those intended
purposes.
 
2. Information on how to use the security settings of the social media platform.
 
3. A statement that the site is regularly monitored and that any inappropriate post will be promptly removed.
Inappropriate posts include those that:
 
a. Are obscene, libelous, or so incite students as to create a clear and present danger of the commission of
unlawful acts on school premises, violation of school rules, or substantial disruption of the school's
orderly operation
 
b. Are not related to the stated purpose of the site, including, but not limited to, comments of a commercial
nature, political activity, and comments that constitute discrimination or harassment
 
4. Protocols for users, including expectations that users will communicate in a respectful, courteous, and
professional manner.
 
5. A statement that users are personally responsible for the content of their posts and that the district is not
responsible for the content of external online platforms.
 
6. A disclaimer that the views and comments expressed on the site are those of the users and do not necessarily
reflect the views of the district.
 
7. A disclaimer that any user's reference to a specific commercial product or service does not imply endorsement
or recommendation of that product or service by the district.
