Instruction shall be provided by appropriately trained instructors who have demonstrated competencies, as
determined by the principal or designee, in the following areas: (Education Code 51260)
1. The ability to interact with students in a positive way
 
2. Knowledge of the properties and effects of tobacco, alcohol, narcotics, dangerous drugs, and shared drug

Intervention
District staff shall intervene whenever students use alcohol or other illegal drugs while on school property or under
school jurisdiction. Staff members who have a reasonable suspicion that a student may be under the influence of
alcohol or drugs shall immediately notify the principal or designee.
If the principal or designee, in his/her professional capacity or in the course of his/her employment, knows, observes
or suspects that a student may be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, he/she may notify the parent/guardian.
(Education Code 44049)
School staff shall not disclose confidential information provided during counseling by a student 12 years of age or
older. A school counselor may report such information to the principal or parent/guardian only when he/she believes
that disclosure is necessary to avert a clear and present danger to the health, safety or welfare of the student or
other persons living in the school community. The school counselor shall not disclose such information to the
parent/guardian if he/she believes that the disclosure would result in a clear and present danger to the student's
health, safety or welfare. (Education Code 44049, 49602)
