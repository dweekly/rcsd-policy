definition of sexual harassment pursuant to 34 CFR 106.30. 
Any other complaint alleging unlawful discrimination or harassment shall be addressed in accordance with the
following procedures: 
1. Notice and Receipt of Complaint: A complainant may inform a direct supervisor, another supervisor, the
coordinator, the Superintendent or, if available, a complaint hotline or an ombudsman. The employee's direct
supervisor may be bypassed in filing a complaint where the supervisor is the subject of the complaint. 
The complainant may first attempt to resolve the situation informally with the complainant's supervisor before
filing a written complaint. 
A supervisor or manager who has received information about an incident of discrimination or harassment, or
has observed such an incident, shall report it to the coordinator, whether or not the complainant files a written
complaint. 
The written complaint should contain the complainant's name, the name of the individual who allegedly
committed the act, a description of the incident, the date and location where the incident occurred, any
witnesses who may have relevant information, other evidence of the discrimination or harassment, and any
other pertinent information which may assist in investigating and resolving the complaint. 
 
2. Investigation Process: The coordinator shall initiate an impartial investigation of an allegation of discrimination
or harassment within five business days of receiving notice of the alleged discriminatory or harassing behavior,
regardless of whether a written complaint has been filed or whether the written complaint is complete. 
The coordinator shall meet with the complainant to describe the district's complaint procedure and discuss the
actions being sought by the complainant in response to the allegation. The coordinator shall inform the
complainant that the investigation of the allegations will be fair, timely, and thorough and will be conducted in
a manner that provides all parties due process and reaches reasonable conclusions based on the evidence
collected. The coordinator shall also inform the parties that the investigation will be kept confidential to the
extent possible, but that some information may be revealed as necessary to conduct an effective investigation. 
If the coordinator determines that a detailed fact-finding investigation is necessary, the investigation shall
begin immediately. As part of this investigation, the coordinator should interview the complainant, the person
accused, and other persons who could be expected to have relevant information. 
â€‹The coordinator shall track and document the progress of the investigation to ensure reasonable progress and
shall inform the parties as necessary. 
When necessary to carry out the investigation or to protect employee safety, the coordinator may discuss the
complaint with the Superintendent or designee, district legal counsel, or the district's risk manager. 
The coordinator shall also determine whether interim measures, such as scheduling changes, transfers, or
leaves, need to be taken before the investigation is completed to ensure that further incidents are prevented.
The coordinator shall ensure that such interim measures do not constitute retaliation. 
 
3. Written Report on Findings and Remedial/Corrective Action: No more than 20 business days after receiving

the complaint, the coordinator shall conclude the investigation and prepare a written report of the findings.
This timeline may be extended for good cause. If an extension is needed, the coordinator shall notify the
parties and explain the reasons for the extension. 
The report shall include the decision and the reasons for the decision and shall summarize the steps taken
during the investigation. If a determination has been made that discrimination or harassment occurred, the
report shall also include any corrective action(s) that have been or will be taken to address the behavior,
provide appropriate options for remedial actions and resolutions for the complainant, and ensure that
retaliation or further discrimination or harassment is prevented. The report shall be presented to the
Superintendent or designee. 
A summary of the findings shall be presented to the complainant and the person accused.
 
4. Appeal to the Governing Board: The complainant or the person accused may appeal any findings to the
Governing Board within 10 business days of receiving the written report of the coordinator's findings. The
Superintendent or designee shall provide the Governing Board with all information presented during the
investigation. Upon receiving an appeal, the Governing Board shall schedule a hearing as soon as practicable.
Any complaint against a district employee shall be addressed in closed session in accordance with law. The
Governing Board shall render its decision within 10 business days.
