================================================================================

To minimize employees' risk of repetitive motion injuries (RMIs), the Superintendent or designee shall implement an
ergonomics program whenever two or more RMIs from an identical work activity have been reported by district
employees within a 12-month period beginning July 3, 1997. In addition, all reported injuries must satisfy all of the
following conditions: (8 CCR 5110)
1. The RMIs were predominantly caused (i.e., 50 percent or more) by a repetitive job, process or operation.
 
2. The employees incurring the RMIs were performing a job process or operation of identical work activity.
Identical work activity means that the employees were performing the same repetitive motion task, such as
similar word processing, assembly or loading tasks.
 
3. The RMIs were musculoskeletal injuries that a licensed physician objectively identified and diagnosed.
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the ergonomics program be designed to minimize RMIs in
accordance with law. The program shall be composed of the following components: (8 CCR 5110)
1. Worksite evaluation
Each job, process or operation of identical work activity, or a representative number of such jobs, processes or
operations of identical activities, shall be evaluated for exposures which have caused RMIs.
 
2. Control of exposures which have caused RMIs
Any exposures that have caused RMIs shall, in a timely manner, be corrected or, if not capable of being
corrected, be minimized to the extent feasible. The district shall consider engineering controls, such as work
station redesign, adjustable fixtures or tool redesign, and administrative controls such as job station, work
pacing or work breaks.
 
3. Training
Employees shall be provided training that includes an explanation of:
 
a. The district's program
 
b. The exposures that have been associated with RMIs
 
c. The symptoms and consequences of injuries caused by repetitive motion
 
d. The importance of reporting symptoms and injuries to the employer
 
e. Methods used by the district to minimize RMIs
