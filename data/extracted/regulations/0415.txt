Purpose
The Governing Board strives to create inclusive and supportive environments for all learners: all abilities, all
ethnicities and cultural identities, LGBTQ +, and Multilingual Learners. The Governing Board believes in the unique
strengths and gifts of each individual student to achieve high intellectual performances for personal success and
acknowledges that disparities exist in learning outcomes based on unintentional or implicit bias and prejudices
toward students perceived as “less”. As respectful and caring adults we affirm our collective responsibility for
cultivating engaged community members. This regulation specifically advises RCSD staff regarding issues related to
dismantling institutional barriers that negatively impact student learning and ensure an equity consciousness lens in
creating policies and administrative regulations across Departments.
The Governing Board recognizes the need for ongoing review of policies and recommends that each department
regularly conduct a review of department policies, procedures, and programs with an equity consciousness lens to
ensure these policies result in fair and just outcomes for all students, staff, and their families. The district’s vision and
goals address the needs of all students, particularly those students who have been most underserved by the
education system. The Governing Board recognizes the inherent value of diversity and acknowledges that
educational excellence requires a commitment to equity in the opportunities provided to all students and community
members.
The Governing Board gives direction to the Superintendent to establish a district-wide Equity Consciousness
standing committee that meets regularly to address issues of equity and ensure the Board Vision and Mission goals
are met. Updates will be provided to the Board at regularly scheduled Board meetings.
It is the Board’s interest to create the most diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace for our staff and educational
environment for our students, so that our mission is achieved and each Department takes collective action toward
equitable outcomes for all students, with particular attention given to historically underserved and underrepresented
community members. The Governing Board requests each Department regularly monitor the impact of district
policies and decisions on all students in order to safeguard against disproportionate or unintentional impact on
access to programs and achievement goals for specific student populations in need of services.
Business Services Department
The Business Services Department commits to differentiating resource allocations, within budgetary limitations and
in accordance with state and federal funding requirements, to eliminate systemic disparities in access to the
resources that all students need to reach high
intellectual performances.
Existing financial resources include, but not limited to:
LCFF Sources
Federal Grants
State Grants
Parcel Tax Revenues
Donations and other local revenue sources
The following procedures outline the process for achieving educational equity and the elimination of personal biases,
racism, and discrimination.
1. The Business Office will ensure information related to students is used in the allocation of funding to each
school site and department. Allocation of funding and other financial resources will be developed and
implemented based upon:
 
a. student enrollment as a baseline data; and 
 
b. if applicable, a differentiated funding formula for schools with significant percentages of students with
greater needs.
 
4. The Business Office will use data analysis and stakeholders’ input in determining the needs of students for

purposes of establishing priorities in the use of the District’s limited resources. The stakeholders’ input can
collectively be referred from the Board, Superintendent, Cabinet and other existing oversight and advisory
committees.
 
5. The Business Office staff will intentionally prioritize services and assistance to teachers and school
administrators so they can deliver timely and proper support to students.
 
6. Business Office staff shall be more intentional and conscious in the choice of words or labels in
communications and financial reporting so as not perpetuate discrimination and racism.
Communications Department
The Communications Department commits to increasing Family/Community Involvement given that “a substantial
body of research demonstrates that family and community participation in schools is important for improving student
achievement, motivating school improvement, and building inclusive school cultures for students of color” (Learning
Policy Institute, 2021). RCSD commits to increasing parent voices including those of parents who are most
impacted by the decisions at hand.
In order to ensure high level customer service that honors and respects all stakeholders, the Communications
Department commits to providing annual training of new parent leadership on multi-communication strategies to
create a culture of strong school home partnerships that includes providing support/training/best practices to
school parent groups (PTO, PTA, SSC, ELAC) on how to lead or be members of site and district committees.
The Communications Department will support District and Site level efforts to engage community members. The
following are suggestions to increase the capacity of all members:
1. Create unified messaging around district initiatives to expand the classroom at home and align common
messages on district initiatives (i.e. Social Emotional Learning themes.)
 
2. Provide guidance training to new district families on the various district and site communication strategies and
channels (i.e. where to look for what, RCSD webpage, Facebook, etc.)
 
3. District and site leadership strive to provide a range of opportunities for family participation that includes one-
time participation opportunities to year long committee work (i.e. naming committee meetings for facility
naming to the ongoing Superintendent Advisory Council meetings.
 
4. Whenever possible, provide interpretation services at site and district level committees, meetings, and written
communications
 
5. Whenever possible, provide a space and time for parents to hear information in Spanish prior to the general
meeting held or provide sessions bilingually.
In order to maximize academic achievement among all significant student groups through family and community
outreach the Communications Department will utilize, but not be limited to, the following activities:
1. Community Conversations
 
2. School Board Meetings
 
3. Principal Coffees
 
4. Parent Advisory Councils, such as District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC), Budget Advisory
Committee (BAC), District Advisory Committee (DAC), School Site Council (SSC), English Learner Advisory
Committee (ELAC), Parent Teacher Student Associations/Organizations and other district and school site
committees
 
5. Published and translated correspondence
 
6. Communications tools such as RCSD Webpage, site level webpages, and social media platforms targeting the
specific needs of each audience
 
7. Communications strategies such as how-to videos as needed (i.e. How to use PowerSchool).

Community Partnerships
The Governing Board acknowledges where strong staff–family relationships exist, parents are engaged as valued
experts and there are regular exchanges between home and schools. The RCSD includes Community-based
partnerships to provide support for children's healthy development to address barriers to learning. Our partnerships
encompass mental health, essential services to address food and shelter insecurities, legal aid and other services that
are identified by families and sites to be of need. The Department of Community Partnerships creates the link
between the instructional school day to the extended learning programs. “A substantial body of research
demonstrates that family and community participation in schools is important for improving student achievement,
motivating school improvement, and building inclusive school cultures for students of color” (Learning Policy
Institute, 2021).
To better support the academic needs of the students served through the community partnerships, the department
will create a stronger alignment of the regular instructional day curriculum to the extended day programs. In this way
there will be sharing of the curricular expectations and academic outcomes with parents during family meetings
hosted by the community partnerships to make transparent the academic outcomes of all students, particularly those
served in the Community Schools. Efforts will be made to replicate existing wrap around services and develop a
structure for supporting high needs students from non-community schools. Formal connections between non-
community schools and community schools will be developed to ensure all students, especially those historically
underserved, receive the services needed.
The Community Partnerships’ department is committed to creating environments that are supportive, welcoming and
inclusive for all families. One way to create and maintain positive relationships with our families, whenever possible,
is to provide a physical space school sites for parents to meet, participate in family development sessions and engage
with one another and site staff during the school day. In this way parents can receive the support they need as well
as begin to connect with one another and their school community.
The department will publish, and if needed, develop and publish clear procedures and protocols for how support
and/or organizations are provided to schools and families. The department will establish clear procedures for
allocating community school resources(financial, personnel and partnerships) throughout the district to create
equitable distribution; thereby, creating school structures and programs that are aligned to the needs of the
community.
The Community Schools will increase partnerships relative to physical health, the arts and college and careers. 
Efforts will be made to foster positive youth development, student voice, and leadership through extended day
partnerships focused on building student strengths, interests, and passions that provide enrichment opportunities for
students that extend learning across multiple disciplines including the arts, STEM, and physical education.
Educational Services Department
The Educational Services Department believes that each student brings experience, assets, and background
knowledge to school each day. It is the responsibility of all Redwood City staff to acknowledge and build on these
assets and strengths so that each student, regardless of language, socio-economic status and race, achieves high
intellectual performances
The Ed Services department will foster and maintain a districtwide culture of inclusion and belonging for each
student, particularly students from historically underserved populations, staff and their families.
The Educational Services Department commits to providing a full and comprehensive curriculum using engaging
instructional practices utilizing the following activities:
Providing sustained coaching and feedback to teachers in the areas of equitable practices and social justice
mindset
Analyzing any new curriculum to be adopted for antiracism philosophy and descriptions
Reviewing current curriculum for an emphasis on social justice and critical pedagogy that ncludes diverse
voices and perspectives in all subject areas 
Incorporating stories of families and their experiences in the curriculum, with teachers paying special attention
to “who is being left out” of the stories that highlight the “funds of knowledge” from families
Cultivating a students’ multilingualism through the use of assetsbased, high quality instruction that promotes
cultural pride and strengthens self-esteem
Developing student agency through student centered and student driven learning opportunities
Expanding the definition of “assessment” to include the inclusion of multiple intelligences/abilities/talents and

higher order skills/high operational practices
Incorporating enriching activities on the foundational belief that each student is gifted in several areas to
maximize and enhance student strengths
Incorporating the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) standards in order to integrate the
“4Cs” creativity, communication, collaboration and critical thinking in the development of instructional
activities, with the outcome of understanding that what we do has an effect on the world outside the
classroom
Health and Wellness Department 
The Health and Wellness Department seeks to provide supportive learning environments for all students that attend
to students’ physical and emotional health and wellbeing. The Governing Board acknowledges that there is a direct
connection between learning and students’ physical and mental health and will implement a cohesive,
comprehensive and focused effort for supporting the physical, social emotional and mental health needs of students.
The Health and Wellness Department will prioritize services to promote emotional health and wellbeing across all
sites, with particular focus on the historically underserved youth.
The Department will work with district and site level leadership to develop and implement a set of strategies to
identify and address the mental health and physical needs of the students, including mental health counseling,
nutrition, trauma informed instruction, and restorative practices . The services will be equitable across the district
with developed criteria for mental health services at each site. The Health and Wellness department will annually
review mental health data, budget allocations and student needs to determine equitable services across the district. 
Each site will utilize the developed criteria to best meet the needs of families and students. Periodic training will be
provided for new or existing members of the site leadership teams, Multi-systems of Support teams (MTSS), or other
similar site level teams to ensure the criteria are met and result in positive support for students and families.
The Health and Wellness Department will work closely with the Departments of Student Services and Community
Partnerships to align the services available. The Governing Board seeks to ensure that school environments are
places that allow students, staff, and other community members to be treated with fair and inclusive practices so
that they feel safe, valued, heard, and respected. The Governing Board understands that students develop a sense of
agency and a healthy sense of identity from those around them, most especially with the adults in schools. To
provide the adults with the professional development and skill set they need to respond to all students and learn
more of how their actions influence students, the district will align actions to the current research on trauma
informed instruction, restorative practices, and social emotional development. The current research will guide the
schools in the development of the Safe and Healthy School Plans to create inclusive and supportive environments for
all learners.
The Health and Wellness Department will work with the school sites to provide physical health services as needed.
Nutrition education, mindfulness practices that develop self-care and resiliency in students will be emphasized and
up to date Immunizations will be a priority. Site nurses will work with the Department Director and site
administrators to ensure the physical health of students is monitored.
Human Resources Department
The Human Resources Department commits to making decisions from an equity consciousness lens to eliminate
inequities and provide for equitable human resource allocations to the fullest extent possible given state or federal
guidelines regarding certification and/or other credential and licensure requirements. Given research shows that
strong connections exist between teacher and principal quality and student success, the Human Resources
Department commits to an ongoing review of employment practices that lead to equitable outcomes for all students,
understanding that RCSD takes collective responsibility to ensure that all RCSD Staff are the voice of encouragement
to dismantle barriers.
The Human Resources Department will recruit and retain high-quality, credentialed teachers and leaders, particularly
educators that reflect the diverse Redwood City School District community and culture of the student population.
The employment practices, from recruitment, the interview process, and moving to hiring will include equity
conscious language and strategies at all junctures of the process including interview questions, job descriptions, and
panel interviews.

1. Vacancies are advertised widely and internally within the organization, as well as through outreach to targeted
groups.

2. Recruitment, interview, selection, training and promotion practices and procedures are non discriminatory.
 
3. The district will recruit, hire, support and develop staff that are most qualified to help students achieve
standards, exceed job level performance outcomes and reflect the community served.
 
4. The most qualified staff is assigned to serve students most in need.
 
5. Prioritize the allocation of district’s human resources in a manner that achieves equitable outcomes for all
students 
The application process will be equitable by making sure the platforms are understood by all applicants with
embedded information on the website available to all. When needed, the HR Department personnel will support
applicants with the website or platforms used for hiring or make available the electronic devices for applying.
Professional development will be provided to all educators to build the capacity of employees regarding student
learning and development and about the racial,
ethnic, and cultural communities served. The onboarding process for all staff will include specific training on implicit
bias, the historical implication of racial inequalities on students, the need for more trauma informed instruction,
social-emotional learning and restorative practices. A more focused professional development session will be offered
to non-teaching staff that also highlights specific topics of implicit bias, the historical implication of racial inequalities
on students, and the staff role in taking collective responsibility to honor all members of the staff and community.
The Department will periodically review data to evaluate for the efficacy of their equitable hiring practices that
include to follow data sets:
Percentage of teachers fully certified for the courses they teach, by school and by student race
Percentage of National Board Certified Teachers, by school
Racial diversity of teachers, by school
Teacher retention rates, by school
Percentage of teachers with more than 3 years of experience, by school
Average class size and pupil load, by school and by course
Student Services Department 
The Students Services Department seeks to build a positive school culture where all students feel understood,
respected and accepted. The Student Services Department will work with RCSD staff and community members so
that all will be the voice of encouragement to dismantle barriers and provide students with learning strategies
needed for personal confidence and future success.

nurturing and supportive environments for all students. The Department of Student Services will work closely with
the site Multi-system of Support Teams or other similar site leadership teams to review site behavioral data by each
significant student group to ensure all students are receiving the appropriate levels of support.
The Student Services Department will provide professional development for new site members that encourage
positive student to student and teacher to student relationships that are the foundation for significant learning to
take place. Restorative Justice practices will also be developed and utilized that promote self-confidence, student
leadership, and develop resiliency in students. Ongoing professional development will be provided that develops
staff skill sets to develop respectful and caring relationships for all students, especially those who exhibit challenging
social emotional behaviors.
The Student Services Department will provide frequent communication to the sites regarding social emotional
themes/topics from the adopted SEL curriculum. Ideas for newsletter items regarding districtwide restorative
practices, PBIS strategies will be shared with families to strengthen home and school connections and reinforce
lessons learned during the school day. 
Activities such as “restorative circles” will be promoted across the district for students and staff to develop a deep
understanding of how their actions affect others and lead to an inclusive, equitable community.
