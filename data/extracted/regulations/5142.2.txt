forms of active transport to school by students may include:
1. Education activities that promote safety and awareness, such as:
 
a. Instructing students about pedestrian and personal safety related to the use of electric or motorized and
nonmotorized bicycles or scooters, including by local law enforcement, organizations specified in

scooters.
 
b. Instructing students about the health, academic, and environmental benefits of walking, bicycling, and
other forms of active transport to school 
 
2. Encouragement strategies designed to generate interest in active transport to school, such as:

school in groups escorted by parents/guardians or other volunteers as needed 
 
b. Organizing special events and activities, such as Walk or Bike to School Day, International Walk to

communications and in any notifications about transportation options 
 
3. Enforcement strategies to deter unsafe behaviors of drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists, such as: 
 
a. Initiating or expanding crossing guard, student safety patrol, and/or parent/guardian safety patrol
programs 
 
b. Partnering with local law enforcement to help ensure that traffic laws are obeyed in the vicinity of
schools and to implement appropriate measures such as placement of speed feedback monitors,
ticketing, and/or driver safety campaigns

nonmotorized scooters wear helmets in accordance with Vehicle Code 21212

devices or physical measures, such as:

gather data about environmental conditions and hazards along routes to school 
 
b. Working with local government agencies to make operational and physical improvements that reduce or
eliminate hazards, such as reducing motor vehicle traffic speeds in the area and establishing safer and
fully accessible crosswalks, walkways, trails, and bikeways 
 
c. Assessing the adequacy, accessibility, and safety of bicycle parking at schools and making modifications
as needed, such as increasing the number of or relocating bicycle racks and/or equipment storage areas 
 
d. Considering safe routes to school when making decisions about siting and designing of new schools 
 
5. Evaluation to assess progress toward program goals, including:

equitable manner across the community
