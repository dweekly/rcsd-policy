District strategies to improve student safety along routes to school and to promote walking, bicycling, and other
forms of active transport to school by students may include:
1. Education activities that promote safety and awareness, such as:
 
a. Instructing students about pedestrian and personal safety related to the use of electric or motorized and
nonmotorized bicycles or scooters, including by local law enforcement, organizations specified in
Education Code 38134, and public agencies that provide safety instructions on such bicycles and
scooters.
 
b. Instructing students about the health, academic, and environmental benefits of walking, bicycling, and
other forms of active transport to school 
 
2. Encouragement strategies designed to generate interest in active transport to school, such as: 
 
a. Organizing or facilitating "walking school buses" and/or "bicycle trains" whereby students walk or bike to
school in groups escorted by parents/guardians or other volunteers as needed 
 
b. Organizing special events and activities, such as Walk or Bike to School Day, International Walk to
School Month, or year-round competitions 
 
c. Publicizing the district's efforts in order to build support of parents/guardians and the community,
including providing information about the district's safe routes to school program in parent/guardian
communications and in any notifications about transportation options 
 
3. Enforcement strategies to deter unsafe behaviors of drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists, such as: 
 
a. Initiating or expanding crossing guard, student safety patrol, and/or parent/guardian safety patrol
programs 
 
b. Partnering with local law enforcement to help ensure that traffic laws are obeyed in the vicinity of
schools and to implement appropriate measures such as placement of speed feedback monitors,
ticketing, and/or driver safety campaigns 
 
c. Monitoring to ensure that students who bicycle to school or who use skateboards, skates, or
nonmotorized scooters wear helmets in accordance with Vehicle Code 21212 
 
4. Engineering strategies that address the design, implementation, operation, and maintenance 3 of traffic control
devices or physical measures, such as:
 
a. Working with local government agencies, parents/guardians, school staff, and others as appropriate to
gather data about environmental conditions and hazards along routes to school 
 
b. Working with local government agencies to make operational and physical improvements that reduce or
eliminate hazards, such as reducing motor vehicle traffic speeds in the area and establishing safer and
fully accessible crosswalks, walkways, trails, and bikeways 
 
c. Assessing the adequacy, accessibility, and safety of bicycle parking at schools and making modifications
as needed, such as increasing the number of or relocating bicycle racks and/or equipment storage areas 
 
d. Considering safe routes to school when making decisions about siting and designing of new schools 
 
5. Evaluation to assess progress toward program goals, including:
 
a. Gathering and interpreting data based on indicators established by the Superintendent and the
Governing Board 
 



b. Presenting data to the Governing Board, program partners, and the public
 
c. Recommending program modifications as needed 
 
6. Emerging technologies that aid in the prevention and mitigation of accidents 
 
7. Emergency response in managing injuries after an accident occurs, including, but not limited to, training staff,
crossing guards, student and/or parent/guardian safety patrols, and other volunteers who assist with drop-off
and pick-up in emergency procedures 
 
8. Equity, such that resources are distributed in a manner that provides safe access and participation in an
equitable manner across the community
