The Governing Board believes in the unique\nstrengths and gifts of each individual student to achieve high intellectual performances for personal success and\nacknowledges that disparities exist in learning outcomes based on unintentional or implicit bias and prejudices\ntoward students perceived as \u201cless\u201d. As respectful and caring adults we affirm our collective responsibility for\ncultivating engaged community members. This regulation specifically advises RCSD staff regarding issues related to\ndismantling institutional barriers that negatively impact student learning and ensure an equity consciousness lens in\ncreating policies and administrative regulations across Departments.\nThe Governing Board recognizes the need for ongoing review of policies and recommends that each department\nregularly conduct a review of department policies, procedures, and programs with an equity consciousness lens to\nensure these policies result in fair and just outcomes for all students, staff, and their families. The district\u2019s vision and\ngoals address the needs of all students, particularly those students who have been most underserved by the\neducation system. The Governing Board recognizes the inherent value of diversity and acknowledges that\neducational excellence requires a commitment to equity in the opportunities provided to all students and community\nmembers.\nThe Governing Board gives direction to the Superintendent to establish a district-wide Equity Consciousness\nstanding committee that meets regularly to address issues of equity and ensure the Board Vision and Mission goals\nare met. Updates will be provided to the Board at regularly scheduled Board meetings.\nIt is the Board\u2019s interest to create the most diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace for our staff and educational\nenvironment for our students, so that our mission is achieved and each Department takes collective action toward\nequitable outcomes for all students, with particular attention given to historically underserved and underrepresented\ncommunity members. The Governing Board requests each Department regularly monitor the impact of district\npolicies and decisions on all students in order to safeguard against disproportionate or unintentional impact on\naccess to programs and achievement goals for specific student populations in need of services.\nBusiness Services Department\nThe Business Services Department commits to differentiating resource allocations, within budgetary limitations and\nin accordance with state and federal funding requirements, to eliminate systemic disparities in access to the\nresources that all students need to reach high\nintellectual performances.\nExisting financial resources include, but not limited to:\nLCFF Sources\nFederal Grants\nState Grants\nParcel Tax Revenues\nDonations and other local revenue sources\nThe following procedures outline the process for achieving educational equity and the elimination of personal biases,\nracism, and discrimination.\n1. The Business Office will ensure information related to students is used in the allocation of funding to each\nschool site and department.

      "content": "The Governing Board believes that the ongoing operation of a charter school established within the district should be dependent on the school's\neffectiveness in achieving its mission and goals for student learning and other student outcomes. Whenever a charter school submits a petition\nfor renewal of its charter, the Board shall review the petition thoroughly and in a timely manner, consistent with the timelines set out in the\nEducation Code. The Board shall consider renewal petitions only of charters originally authorized by the Board itself or by the State Board of\nEducation on appeal after initial denial by the Board.\n(cf. 0420.4 - Charter School Authorization) (cf. 0420.41 - Charter School Oversight) (cf. 0420.43 - Charter School Revocation) (cf. 0500 - Accountability)\nThe Board shall deny the renewal petition of any charter school operated as or by a for-profit corporation, a for-profit educational management\norganization, or a for-profit charter management organization. (Education Code 47604)\nWhen a charter school, concurrently with its renewal petition, proposes to expand operations to one or more additional sites or grade levels, the\ncharter school shall request a material revision to its charter. The material revision may be made only with the approval of the Board and in\naccordance with the standards and criteria in Education Code 47605 for material revisions. (Education Code 47607)\nThe Board recommends that a charter school submit its petition for renewal to the Board sufficiently early before the expiration of the term of\nthe charter to allow the Board's deliberations and decision on the renewal petition to be completed with minimal disruption to the charter\nschool's educational program in the renewal year.\nThe petition for renewal shall include a reasonably comprehensive description of how the charter school has met all new charter school\nrequirements enacted into law after the charter was originally granted or last renewed. (Education Code 47607; 5 CCR 11966.4)\nCriteria for Granting or Denying Renewal\nRenewals shall be governed by the same standards and criteria that apply to new charter petitions as set forth in Education Code 47605.\nHowever, a charter renewal shall not be denied based on the fiscal impact of the charter school on the district or a finding that the charter school\nis unlikely to serve the interests of the entire community in which the school is located, as described in Education Code 47605. (Education Code\n47607)\nThe signature requirement for charter authorization petitions is not applicable to petitions for renewal. (Education Code 47607)\nIn determining whether to grant a charter renewal, the Board shall review both schoolwide performance and the performance of numerically\nsignificant student subgroups on the state and local indicators included in the California School Dashboard, giving greater weight to performance\non measurements of academic performance. If the Dashboard indicators are not yet available for the most recently completed academic year\nbefore renewal, the Board shall consider verifiable data provided by the charter school related to the Dashboard indicators, such as data from the\nCalifornia Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, or any successor system, for the most recent academic year. The Board shall only\nconsider data from sources adopted by SBE. (Education Code 47607, 47607.2)\nFollowing the Board's review, a renewal of the charter petition may be granted in accordance with a three-tiered system based on school\nperformance, as follows:\nRenewal of Five to Seven Years\nA charter school that is not eligible for technical assistance pursuant to Education Code 47607.3 shall be granted renewal for a period of five to\nseven years when, for two consecutive years immediately preceding the renewal, or for two of the three years immediately preceding the\nrenewal for any renewal submitted in the 2020-21 or 2021-22 school year, the charter school achieved either of the following: (Education Code\n47607)\nReceived the two highest performance levels schoolwide on all the state indicators included in the Dashboard for which the charter school\nreceives performance levels, provided the charter school has schoolwide performance levels on at least two measurements of academic\nperformance per year in each of the two years\nFor all measurements of academic performance, received performance levels schoolwide that are the same or higher than the state average and,\nfor a majority of numerically significant student subgroups performing statewide below the state average in each respective year, received\nperformance levels that are higher than the state average provided that the charter school has performance levels on at least two measurements\nof academic performance for at least two subgroups\nIf the charter school satisfies the above criteria, it shall only be required to update the renewal petition to include a reasonably comprehensive\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\ndescription of any new requirement of charter schools enacted into law after the charter was originally granted or last renewed and, as necessary,\nto reflect the current program offered by the charter school. (Education Code 47607)\nRenewal of Five Years\nA renewal shall be granted for five years if clear and convincing evidence, demonstrated by verified data, shows either of the following:\n(Education Code 47607.2)\nMeasurable increases in academic achievement, as defined by at least one year's progress for each year in school; and\nStrong postsecondary outcomes, as defined by college enrollment, persistence, and completion rates equal to similar peers\nFor any such charter school, the Board may deny the renewal petition upon making written factual findings that the charter school failed to meet\nor make sufficient progress toward meeting standards that provide a benefit to students at the school, that the closure of the charter school is in\nthe best interest of students, and that the Board\u2019s decision provided greater weight to performance on measurements of academic performance.\n(Education Code 47607.2)\nDenial/Two-Year Renewal\nThe Board shall generally not renew a charter if, for two consecutive years immediately preceding the renewal decision, or for two of the three\nyears immediately preceding the renewal for any renewal submitted in the 2020-21 or 2021-22 school year, either of the following applies:\n(Education Code 47607.2)\nThe charter school has received the two lowest performance levels schoolwide on all the state indicators included in the Dashboard for which it\nreceives performance levels, provided the charter school has schoolwide performance levels on at least two measurements of academic\nperformance per year in each of the two years\nFor all measurements of academic performance, the charter school has received performance levels schoolwide that are the same or lower than\nthe state average and, for a majority of numerically significant student subgroups performing statewide below the state average in each\nrespective year, received performance levels that are lower than the state average, provided that the charter school has performance levels on at\nleast two measurements of academic performance for at least two subgroups\nHowever, the Board may grant a two-year renewal to any such charter school if the Board makes written factual findings, setting forth specific\nfacts to support the findings, that:\nThe charter school is taking meaningful steps to address the underlying cause(s) of low performance, and those steps are reflected, or will be\nreflected, in a written plan adopted by the governing body of the charter school.\nThere is clear and convincing evidence, demonstrated by verified data, showing achievement of the criteria as specified above.\nIn addition to all the grounds stated above for denial of a charter renewal, the Board may deny renewal of a charter upon a finding that the school\nis demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition due to substantial fiscal or governance factors or a\nfinding that the school is not serving all students who wish to attend. When denying a charter renewal for either of these reasons, the Board shall\nprovide the charter school at least 30 days' notice of the alleged violation and a reasonable opportunity to cure the violation, including the\nsubmission of a proposed corrective action plan. The renewal may be denied by the Board for these reasons only upon a finding that either the\ncorrective action proposed by the charter school has been unsuccessful or that the violations are sufficiently severe and pervasive as to render a\ncorrective action plan unviable. Any finding that a school is not serving all students who wish to attend shall specifically identify the evidence\nsupporting the finding. (Education Code 47607)\nA charter school that is eligible for the state's Dashboard Alternative School Status shall not be subject to any of the above criteria. Instead, in\ndetermining whether to grant a charter renewal for such a charter school, the Board shall consider, in addition to the charter school's\nperformance on the state and local indicators included in the Dashboard, the charter school's performance on alternative metrics applicable to\nthe charter school based on the student population served. The Board shall meet with the charter school during the first year of the charter\nschool's term to mutually agree to discuss alternative metrics to be considered and shall notify the charter school of the alternative metrics to be\nused within 30 days of this meeting. The Board may deny a charter renewal only upon making written findings, setting forth specific facts to\nsupport the findings, that the closure of the charter school is in the best interest of students. (Education Code 47607)\nTimelines for Board Action\nWithin 60 days of receiving the renewal petition, the Board shall hold a public hearing to review documentation submitted by the charter school\nand obtain public input. A petition is deemed received on the day the petitioner submits a petition to the district office, along with a signed\ncertification that the petitioner deems the petition to be complete.\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nThe Board shall either grant or deny the charter renewal within 90 days of receiving the petition, or within 120 days with the consent of both the\npetitioner and the Board. (Education Code 47605)\nAt least 15 days before the public hearing at which the Board will grant or deny the charter petition, the Board shall publish all staff\nrecommendations and recommended findings regarding the petition. During the public hearing, petitioners shall have equal time and opportunity\nto present evidence and testimony to respond to the staff recommendations and findings. (Education Code 47605)\nIf the Board fails to make a written factual finding when required for denial of the petition pursuant to the section \"Criteria for Granting or\nDenying Renewal\" above within the required time period, the absence of a written factual finding shall be deemed an approval of the renewal\npetition. (5 CCR 11966.4)\nThe Superintendent or designee shall provide notification to CDE, within 10 calendar days of the Board's action, whenever a renewal of the\ncharter is granted or denied. (Education Code 47604.32; 5 CCR 11962.1)\nIf the Board denies a renewal petition, the charter school may submit its application for renewal to the County Board within 30 days of the\nBoard's written factual findings supporting the denial. (Education Code 47605, 47607.5)\nSchool Closure\nIf a charter is not renewed and the charter school ceases opera$on, the Board and/or the charter school shall implement the school closure\nprocedures specified in the charter in accordance with Education Code 47605 and 5 CCR 11962.

      "content": "The Board of Education expects any charter school it authorizes to provide a sound educational program that\npromotes student learning and to carry out its operations in a manner that complies with law and the terms of its\ncharter.\nThe Board may revoke a charter before the date it is due to expire whenever the Board makes a written factual\nfinding, supported by substantial evidence, that the charter school has done any of the following: (Education Code\n47607)\n1. Committed a material violation of any of the conditions, standards, or procedures set forth in the charter\n \n2. Failed to meet or pursue any of the student outcomes identified in the charter\n \n3. Failed to meet generally accepted accounting principles or engaged in fiscal mismanagement\n \n4. Violated any provision of law\nThe Board shall also consider revocation of a charter whenever the California Collaborative for Educational\nExcellence (CCEE), after providing advice and assistance to the charter school pursuant to Education Code 47607.3,\nsubmits to the Board either of the following findings: (Education Code 47607.3)\n1. That the charter school has failed or is unable to implement the recommendations of the CCEE\n \n2. That the inadequate performance of the charter school, as based on an evaluation rubric adopted by the State\nBoard of Education (SBE), is so persistent or acute as to require revocation of the charter\nIn determining whether to revoke a charter, the Board shall consider increases in student academic achievement for\nall \"numerically significant\" groups of students served by the charter school, as defined in Education Code 52052, as\nthe most important factor. (Education Code 47607, 47607.3)\nAt least 72 hours prior to any Board meeting at which the Board will consider issuing a Notice of Violation, the Board\nshall provide the charter school with notice and all relevant documents related to the proposed action. (5 CCR\n11968.5.2)\nIf the Board takes action to issue a Notice of Violation, it shall deliver the Notice of Violation to the charter school's\ngoverning body. The Notice of Violation shall identify: (Education Code 47607; 5 CCR 11965, 11968.5.2)\n1. The charter school's alleged violation(s).\n \n2. All evidence relied upon by the Board in determining that the charter school committed the alleged violation(s),\nincluding the date and duration of the alleged violation(s). The Notice shall show that each alleged violation is\nboth material and uncured and that it occurred within a reasonable period of time before the Notice of\nViolation is issued.\n \n3. The period of time that the Board has concluded is a reasonable period of time for the charter school to\nremedy or refute the identified violation(s). In identifying this time period, the Board shall consider the amount\nof time reasonably necessary to remedy each identified violation, which may include the charter school's\nestimation as to the anticipated remediation time.\nBy the end of the remedy period identified in the Notice of Violation, the charter school's governing body may\nsubmit to the Board a detailed written response and supporting evidence addressing each identified violation,\nincluding the refutation, remedial action taken, or proposed remedial action. (5 CCR 11968.5.2)\nWithin 60 calendar days of the conclusion of the remedy period, the Board shall evaluate any response and\nsupporting evidence provided by the charter school's governing body and shall take one of the following actions: (5\nCCR 11968.5.2)\n1. Discontinue revocation of the charter and provide timely written notice of such action to the charter school's\ngoverning body\n \nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\n2. If there is substantial evidence that the charter school has failed to remedy a violation identified in the Notice\nof Violation or to refute a violation to the Board's satisfaction, continue revocation of the charter by issuing a\nNotice of Intent to Revoke to the charter school's governing body\nIf the Board issues a Notice of Intent to Revoke, it shall hold a public hearing concerning the revocation on the date\nspecified in the notice, which shall be no later than 30 days after providing the notice. Within 30 calendar days after\nthe public hearing, or within 60 calendar days if extended by written mutual agreement of the Board and the charter\nschool, the Board shall issue a final decision to revoke or decline to revoke the charter. (Education Code 47607; 5\nCCR 11968.5.2)\nIf the Board fails to meet the timelines specified above for issuing a Notice of Intent to Revoke or a final decision, the\nrevocation process shall be deemed terminated.\nWithin 10 calendar days of the Board's final decision, the Superintendent or designee shall provide a copy of the final\ndecision to the California Department of Education (CDE) and the County Board of Education. (Education Code\n47604.32; 5 CCR 11968.5.2)\nSevere and Imminent Threat\nThe procedures specified above shall not be applicable when the Board determines, in writing, that any violation\nunder Education Code 47607 constitutes a severe and imminent threat to the health or safety of students. In such\ncircumstances, the Board may immediately revoke the school's charter by approving and delivering a Notice of\nRevocation by Determination of a Severe and Imminent Threat to Pupil Health or Safety to the charter school's\ngoverning body, the County Board, and the CDE. (Education Code 47607; 5 CCR 11968.5.3)\nAppeals\nIf the Board revokes a charter, the charter school may, within 30 days of the Board's final decision, appeal the\nrevocation to the County Board. Either the charter school or the district may subsequently appeal the County\nBoard's decision to the SBE. However, a revocation based upon the findings of the CCEE pursuant to Education\nCode 47607.3 may not be appealed. (Education Code 47607, 47607.3; 5 CCR 11968.5.3-11968.5.5)",

      "content": "The following policy establishes procedures for the review of charter petitions. These schools shall operate under the\nprovisions of their charters, federal laws, specified state laws, and general oversight of the Board.\nThe Board of Education recognizes that charter schools may assist the district in offering diverse learning\nopportunities for students. In considering any petition to establish a charter school within the district, the Board shall\ngive thoughtful consideration to the potential of the charter school to provide students with a high-quality education\nthat enables them to achieve to their fullest potential.\nOne or more persons may submit a petition for a start-up charter school to be established within the district. In\naddition, an existing district school may be converted to a charter school when deemed beneficial by the district and\ncommunity. (Education Code 47605, 47606, 53300)\nThe district shall not require any district student to attend the charter school nor shall it require any district\nemployee to work at the charter school. (Education Code 47605)\nAny petition for a start-up charter school or conversion charter school shall include all components and signatures\nrequired by law and shall be submitted to the Board. The Superintendent or designee shall consult with legal counsel,\nas appropriate, regarding compliance of the charter proposals with legal requirements.\nThe Superintendent or designee may work with charter school petitioners prior to the formal submission of the\npetition in order to gather information about the proposal and suggest components that would align the petition with\nthe district's vision and goals for student learning. As needed, they may work with the petitioners to establish\nworkable plans for technical assistance or contracted services, which the district may provide to the proposed\ncharter school.\nWithin 30 days of receiving a petition to establish a charter school, the Board shall hold a public hearing to determine\nthe level of support for the petition by teachers, other employees of the district, and parents/guardians. (Education\nCode 47605)\nWithin 60 days of receiving a petition, or within 90 days with mutual consent of the petitioners and the Board, the\nBoard shall either approve or deny the request to establish the charter school. (Education Code 47605)\nThe approval or denial of a charter petition shall not be controlled by collective bargaining agreements nor subject to\nreview or regulation by the Public Employment Relations Board. (Education Code 47611.5)\nApproval of Petition\nThe Board shall approve the charter petition if doing so is consistent with sound educational practice. In granting\ncharters, the Board shall give preference to schools best able to provide comprehensive learning experiences for\nacademically low-achieving students according to standards established by the California Department of Education\n(CDE) under Education Code 54032. (Education Code 47605)\nThe Board may initially grant a charter for a specified term not to exceed five years. (Education Code 47607)\nThe Board shall ensure that any approved charter contains adequate processes and measures for holding the school\naccountable for fulfilling the terms of its charter. These shall include, but are not limited to, fiscal accountability\nsystems, multiple measures for evaluating the educational program, including student outcomes aligned with state\npriorities as described in Education Code 52060, and regular reports to the Board.\nThe Board may approve one or more memoranda of understanding to clarify the financial and operational\nagreements between the district and the charter school. Any such memorandum of understanding shall be annually\nreviewed by the Board and charter school governing body and amended as necessary.\nIt shall be the responsibility of the petitioners to provide written notice of the Board's approval and a copy of the\ncharter to the County Superintendent of Schools, the CDE, and the State Board of Education (SBE). (Education Code\n47605)\nDenial of Petition\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nThe Board shall deny any petition to authorize the conversion of a private school to a charter school. The Board shall\nalso deny any petition for a charter that proposes to serve students in a grade level that is not served by the district,\nunless the petition proposes to serve students in all the grade levels served by the district. (Education Code 47602,\n47605)\nAny other charter petition shall be denied only if the Board makes written factual findings specific to the petition\nthat one or more of the following conditions exist: (Education Code 47605)\n1. The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the students to be enrolled in the charter\nschool.\n \n2. The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition.\n \n3. The petition does not contain the number of signatures required.\n \n4. The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in Education Code 47605(d).\n \n5. The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of the charter provisions in Education\nCode 47605(b).\n \n6. The petition does not contain a declaration as to whether or not the charter school shall be deemed the\nexclusive public school employer of the school's employees for purposes of collective bargaining pursuant to\nGovernment Code 3540-3549.3.\nThe Board shall not deny a petition based on the actual or potential costs of serving students with disabilities, nor\nshall it deny a petition solely because the charter school might enroll students with disabilities who reside outside the\nspecial education local plan area in which the district participates. (Education Code 47605.7, 47647)\nIf the Board denies a petition, the petitioners may choose to submit the petition to the County Board of Education\nand, if then denied by the County Board, to the SBE.

The IDEA addendum shall be\ndeveloped, reviewed, and approved in conjunction with and in the same manner as the LCAP and the annual update to the\nLCAP, and shall be submitted to CDE within 15 days of adoption by the Board. (Education Code 52064.3)\nThe Superintendent or designee shall review the single plan for student achievement (SPSA) submitted by each district school\npursuant to Education Code 64001 to ensure that the specific actions included in the LCAP are consistent with strategies\nincluded in the SPSA.

To the extent possible, the Board shall be proactive in defining the\ndistrict's advocacy agenda based on the needs of the district and the direction set forth in the district's vision and\ngoals.\nThe Board may establish reasonable regulations related to Board members and employees engaging in political\nactivity during working hours and on district premises. (Education Code 7055)\nLegislation\nThe Board's responsibility as an advocate for the district may include lobbying at the state and national levels.\nBecause local governments also make decisions which impact the district's schools, the Board and the\nSuperintendent or designee shall work to establish ongoing relationships with city and county officials and agencies,\nand shall inform them of the potential effect of local issues on the schools.\nThe Board shall identify issues that will affect its schools and the children in its community, establish goals and\npriorities for legislative advocacy, solicit community input and adopt legislative positions. The Superintendent or\ndesignee shall establish a coordinated plan for carrying out the advocacy agenda, including specific activities, target\ngroups or individuals, staff responsibilities and timelines.\nIn order to strengthen legislative advocacy efforts, the district may work with organizations and coalitions and may\njoin associations whose representatives lobby on behalf of their members.\nAs necessary, the Superintendent or designee may draft legislative proposals which serve the district's interests.\nThe Board may provide fair and impartial information about legislative issues affecting schools and children and shall\ninform the community about its legislative advocacy activities.\nBallot Measures/Candidates\nThe Board may study the potential effect of ballot measures on the district's schools. Any Board discussion of the\neffect of such measures shall include an opportunity for Board members, staff and members of the public to speak\non all sides of the issue. Following such study, the Board may adopt positions in support of or in opposition to ballot\nmeasures of importance to education.\nThe Board's positions shall be publicized only through normal district procedures for reporting Board actions and in a\nmanner that does not attempt to influence voters.\nNo district funds, services, supplies or equipment shall be used to urge the support or defeat of any ballot measure or\ncandidate, including any candidate for election to the Board. (Education Code 7054)\nDistrict resources shall not be used to disseminate campaign literature or to purchase advertisements, bumper\nstickers, posters or similar promotional items that advocate an election result.\nThe Superintendent or designee may use district resources to provide students, parents/guardians and community\nmembers with fair and impartial information related to ballot measures, including information about the impact of\nballot measures on the district. (Education Code 7054)\nIn preparing or distributing such information, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the totality of the\ncircumstances, including language, style, tenor and timing, does not expressly advocate passage or defeat of a\nmeasure or candidate.\nThe Superintendent or designee may research, draft and prepare a bond measure or other initiative for the ballot, but\nshall not use district resources to secure signatures in order to qualify the measure for the ballot.\nUpon request, Board members and district administrators may appear at any time before a citizens' group to explain\nwhy the Board called for an election on a bond measure and to answer questions. (Education Code 7054.1)\nIf the presentation occurs during working hours, the district representative shall not urge a citizens' group to vote for\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nor against the bond measure.\nFor informational purposes, the Superintendent or designee may conduct a poll related to a ballot issue. Such a poll\nshall not advocate a particular position on the issue.\nLegal Advocacy\nThe Board recognizes that some issues are more appropriately addressed judicially rather than legislatively. When a\nlegal issue is likely to set a state or national precedent, the district may join with other districts or parties in order to\nchallenge the issue through litigation or other appropriate means.\nPolitical Forums\nForums on political issues may be held in district facilities as long as the forum is made available to all sides of the\nissue on an equitable basis.

As a result of the passage of Proposition 39, language was added\nto the Education Code requiring school districts passing a bond designated as a Proposition 39 bond to\nestablish a citizens\u2019 oversight committee (\u201cCommittee\u201d) to actively review and report to the public on uses of\nbond proceeds to ensure that they are spent only on permissible purposes. In order to comply with these\nrequirements, the District\u2019s Board of Trustees shall establish a Committee within sixty (60) days of the date\nthat the Board enters election results of a successful Proposition 39 general election bond measure in its\nminutes.\nA.

If the parties agree to mediation, the compliance officer shall\nmake all arrangements for this process.\nBefore initiating the mediation of a discrimination complaint alleging retaliation or unlawful discrimination\n\n(such as discriminatory harassment, intimidation, or bullying), the compliance officer shall ensure that all\nparties agree to make the mediator a party to related confidential information.

Such evidence or information may be presented at any time during\nthe investigation.\nIn conducting the investigation, the compliance officer shall collect all available documents and review all\navailable records, notes, or statements related to the complaint, including any additional evidence or\ninformation received from the parties during the course of the investigation. The compliance officer shall\nindividually interview all available witnesses with information pertinent to the complaint, and may visit any\nreasonably accessible location where the relevant actions are alleged to have taken place. At appropriate\nintervals, the compliance officer shall inform both parties of the status of the investigation.\nTo investigate a complaint alleging retaliation or unlawful discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment,\nintimidation, or bullying), the compliance officer shall interview the alleged\nvictim(s), any alleged offenders, and other relevant witnesses privately, separately, and in a confidential\nmanner. As necessary, additional staff or legal counsel may conduct or support the investigation.\nA complainant's refusal to provide the district's investigator with documents or other evidence related to the\nallegations in the complaint, failure or refusal to cooperate in the investigation, or engagement in any other\nobstruction of the investigation may result in the dismissal of the complaint because of a lack of evidence to\nsupport the allegation. Similarly, a respondent's refusal to provide the district's investigator with documents\nor other evidence related to the allegations in the complaint, failure or refusal to cooperate in the\ninvestigation, or engagement in any other obstruction of the investigation may result in a finding, based on\nevidence collected, that a violation has occurred and in the imposition of a remedy in favor of the\ncomplainant. (5 CCR 4631)\nIn accordance with law, the district shall provide the investigator with access to records and other\ninformation related to the allegation in the complaint and shall not in any way obstruct the investigation.\nFailure or refusal of the district to cooperate in the investigation may result in a finding based on evidence\ncollected that a violation has occurred and in the imposition of a remedy in favor of the complainant.

Within 30 calendar days of\nreceiving the complaint, the compliance officer shall prepare and send to the complainant a written report, as\n\ndescribed in the section \u201cInvestigation Report\u201d below. If the complainant is dissatisfied with the compliance\nofficer's decision, the complainant may, within five business days, file the complaint in writing with the\nBoard. Due to the fact the district allows appeals to the Board, the compliance officer's decision must be\nprepared and sent within 30 calendar days so that the Board's decision can still be given within the 60-day\ntime limit.\nThe Board may consider the matter at its next regular Board meeting or at a special Board meeting convened\nin order to meet the 60-day time limit within which the complaint must be answered. When required by law,\nthe matter shall be considered in closed session. The Board may decide not to hear the complaint, in which\ncase the compliance officer's decision shall be final.\nIf the Board hears the complaint, the compliance officer shall send the Board's decision to the complainant\nwithin 60 calendar days of the district's initial receipt of the complaint or within the time period that has\nbeen specified in a written agreement with the complainant. (5 CCR 4631)\nFor any complaint alleging unlawful discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment, intimidation, and\nbullying), the respondent shall be informed of any extension of the timeline agreed to by the complainant,\nshall be sent the district's investigation report and, in the same manner as the complainant, may file a\ncomplaint with the Board if dissatisfied with the decision.\nInvestigation Report\nFor all complaints, the district's investigation report shall include: \n(5 CCR 4631)\n1. The findings of fact based on the evidence gathered.\n \n2. A conclusion providing a clear determination for each allegation as to whether the district is in\ncompliance with the relevant law\n \n3. Corrective action(s) whenever the district finds merit in the complaint, including, when required by law,\na remedy to all affected students and parents/guardians and, for a student fees complaint, a remedy\nthat complies with Education Code 49013 and 5 CCR 4600.\n \n4.

In a complaint alleging unlawful discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment, intimidation,\nand bullying), notice of the investigation report to the alleged victim shall include information about any\nsanction to be imposed upon the respondent that relates directly to the alleged victim.\nIf the complaint involves a limited-English-proficient student or parent/guardian and the student involved is\nenrolled in a school at which 15 percent or more of the students speak a single primary language other than\nEnglish, then the investigation report shall also be translated into that language pursuant to Education Code\n48985. In all other instances, the district shall ensure meaningful access to all relevant information for\nparents/guardians with limited English proficiency.\nFor complaints alleging unlawful discrimination based on state law (such as discriminatory harassment,\nintimidation, and bullying), the investigation report shall also include a notice to the complainant that:\n\n1. The complainant may pursue available civil law remedies outside of the district's complaint procedures,\nincluding seeking assistance from mediation centers or public/private interest attorneys, 60 calendar days after\nthe filing of an appeal with the CDE.

(Education Code 262.3)\n \n3. Complaints alleging discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, gender, disability, or age\nmay also be filed with the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights at www.ed.gov/ocr\nwithin 180 days of the alleged discrimination.\nCorrective Actions\nWhen a complaint is found to have merit, the compliance officer shall adopt any appropriate corrective\naction permitted by law. Appropriate corrective actions that focus on the larger school or district\nenvironment may include, but are not limited to, actions to reinforce district policies; training for faculty,\nstaff, and students; updates to school policies; or school climate surveys.\nFor complaints involving retaliation or unlawful discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment,\nintimidation, or bullying), appropriate remedies that may be offered to the victim but not communicated to\nthe respondent may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n1. Counseling\n \n2. Academic support\n \n3. Health services\n \n4. Assignment of an escort to allow the victim to move safely about campus\n \n5.

The legal conclusion in the district's investigation report is inconsistent with the law.\n \n5. In a case in which the district found noncompliance, the corrective actions fail to provide a proper\nremedy.\nUpon notification by CDE that the district's investigation report has been appealed, the Superintendent or\ndesignee shall forward the following documents to CDE within 10 days of the date of notification: (5 CCR\n4633)\n1.

      "content": "The Board of Trustees desires to promote positive relationships between schools and the community in order to\nenhance community support and involvement in the districts' schools. The Board believes that businesses and other\norganizations play an important role in supporting schools and students. To that end the Board supports\ncollaborations between the community, businesses and district such that business leaders, educators, parents and\ndistrict officials work together to generate revenue sources within a practical, responsible system that protects the\nintegrity of our district and schools.\nActivities resulting from these collaborations may include: sponsorship, partnerships, fundraising, advertising, product\ndonation and naming rights.\n1. Naming Rights\nThe Superintendent or designee may work with potential business partners to develop a proposed agreement\nabout naming rights for buildings, wings of buildings, libraries, and other locations on district property. All\ndecisions regarding naming rights shall ultimately be the decision of the Board. All monies generated from such\na matter shall be for general purposes and not directed to any individual school or program and shall be in\naccordance with all board policies including the wellness policy. Duration of the agreement shall be determined\nthrough a negotiation but shall last no longer than five years.\nPrior to the distribution of any publication from an outside organization, the Superintendent or designee shall\nreview and may approve all advertising copy and promotional materials to ensure compliance with Board\npolicy.\n \n2. Promotional Materials from Outside Organizations\nThe Board recognizes the many worthwhile organizations that seek to inform the school community about\nevents and activities of interest to children. The Board of Education's mission and goals are focused on\nimproving academic achievement and the district's resources must be directed to providing the highest quality\neducational program to all students. Because such promotion requires clerical support and teacher time, no-fee\npromotion is limited to:\n \nJoint-use partners as established in a memo of understanding (content must be focused on the joint-use\npartner's program for youth conducted for district students);\n \nContracted programs (e.g., district grants) approved by the board (flier content must be focused on\ncontracted programs conducted primarily on district campuses for district students);\n \nThe Redwood City Education Foundation (RCEF) and Parent-teacher organization promotion of school\nsite-related and district events, activities, and programs (not the events of other agencies or\norganizations);\n \nGovernmental agencies, such as the park and recreation department, police and fire, that wish to\ndistribute materials pertaining to student and community recreation, health and safety.\nAll other promotional requests require approval by the Superintendent or designee and must pay\npromotional fees as described in AR 1325. All promotional materials for fee must adhere to the policy\ndescribed in #3 below.\nAll promotional materials that fit the criteria above must be submitted to the Superintendent or designee\nfor prior approval at least two weeks prior to distribution, and must be distributed within 30 days of\napproval. If approved, a flier must be translated into Spanish, and offered to parents in both English and\nSpanish.\n \n3. Paid promotion and advertisements in school-sponsored publications, yearbooks, announcements and other\nschool communications\nThe use of promotional materials or advertisements does not imply district endorsement of any identified\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nproducts or services. Schools shall include a disclaimer in school publications and yearbooks stating that the\nschool does not endorse any advertised products or services.\n \n4. Products and materials may be donated by commercial enterprises for use in the classroom, as long as they\nserve an educational purpose and do not unduly promote any commercial activity or products. (Such material\nmay bear the name and/or logo of the donor.)\nThe Superintendent, principal or designee may selectively approve or disapprove distribution of materials or\npublishing of paid advertising copy based on the criteria listed below, but may not copy in an arbitrary or capricious\nmanner or in a way that discriminates against a particular viewpoint on a subject that would otherwise be allowed.\nAll materials to be distributed shall bear the name and contact information of the sponsoring entity.\nCriteria for Approval\nThe Superintendent or designee shall not accept for distribution or posting advertisements or materials that:\n1. Are obscene, libelous or slanderous (Education Code 48907).\n \n2. Incite students to commit unlawful acts, violate school rules or disrupt the orderly operation of the schools\n(Education Code 48907).\n \n3. Promote any particular political interest, candidate, party or ballot measure, unless such materials are being\ndistributed at a forum in which candidates or advocates from all sides are presenting their views to the\nstudents during school hours or during events scheduled pursuant to the Civic Center Act.\n \n4. Discriminate against, attack or denigrate any group on account of any unlawful consideration.\n \n5. Promote the use or sale of materials or services that are illegal or inconsistent with school objectives or\nDistrict policy, including the Wellness policy (BP5030), and including but not limited to materials or\nadvertisements for tobacco, intoxicants, and movies or products unsuitable for children.\n \n6. Solicit funds or services for an organization, with the exception of solicitations authorized in Board policy.\n \n7. Distribute unsolicited merchandise for which an ensuing payment is requested. The Superintendent or\ndesignee also may consider the educational value of the materials or advertisements, the age or maturity of\nstudents in the intended audience, and whether the materials or advertisements support the basic educational\nmission of the district, directly benefit the students or are of intrinsic value to the students or their\nparents/guardians.\nSchools may establish additional criteria pertaining to the content of advertisements in school publications and\nyearbooks. Such criteria may limit advertisements to those that contain congratulatory or commemorative messages,\ncurriculum-related content, advertisements for products or services of interest to students, non-controversial\ncontent, and/or other content deemed appropriate by the school publication staff and adviser in accordance with\nlaw and Board policy. Schools may impose content-based restrictions in order to minimize chances of abuse, the\nappearance of favoritism, and the risk of imposing upon a captive audience.",

Assist in identifying records and information responsive to the request or the purpose of the request, if\nspecified\nIf after making a reasonable effort to elicit additional clarifying information from the requester to help identify\nthe record, the Superintendent or designee is still unable to identify the information, this requirement shall be\ndeemed satisfied.\n \n2. Describe the information technology and physical location in which the records exist\n \n3. Provide suggestions for overcoming any practical basis for denying access to the records or information sought\nProvisions of the Public Records Act shall not be construed so as to delay access for purposes of inspecting records\nopen to the public.

The district budget shall guide administrative decisions and actions\nthroughout the year and shall serve as a tool for monitoring the fiscal health of the district.\nThe district budget shall show a complete plan and itemized statement of all proposed expenditures and all\nestimated revenues for the following fiscal year, together with a comparison of revenues and expenditures for the\ncurrent fiscal year. The budget shall also include the appropriations limit and the total annual appropriations.\n(Education Code 42122)\nSingle Budget Adoption Process\nThe Superintendent or designee shall establish an annual budget development process and calendar in accordance\nwith the single budget adoption process described in Education Code 42127.\nThe Superintendent shall oversee the preparation of a proposed district budget for approval by the Board and shall\ninvolve appropriate staff at all levels in the development of budget projections.\nThe Board encourages public input in the budget development process and shall hold public hearings and meetings in\naccordance with law.\nThe Superintendent or designee may appoint a financial advisory committee composed of members of the\ncommunity and staff. The committee shall provide recommendations to the Superintendent during the budget\ndevelopment process. Duties of the committee shall be clearly defined and communicated to all members.\nIn order to provide guidance in the development of the budget, the Board shall annually establish budget priorities\nbased on identified district needs and goals and on realistic projections of available funds. The Board also shall\nestablish budget assumptions or parameters which may take into consideration the stability of funding sources,\nenrollment trends, legal requirements and constraints, anticipated increases and/or decreases in the cost of services\nand supplies, use of one-time resources, categorical program requirements, scheduled salary increases, and any other\nfactors necessary to ensure that the budget is a realistic plan for district revenues and expenditures.\nThe Board shall establish and maintain a general fund reserve for economic uncertainty of at least 6%.\nPrior to adopting the budget, the Board shall conduct a first-tier review, and if necessary a second-tier review, to\nensure that the budget meets standards and criteria adopted by the State Board of Education. (Education Code\n33127, 33128, 33129; 5 CCR 15440-15452)\nThe Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district budget is clearly presented and effectively\ncommunicated to the Board, staff, and public. He/she may adapt or supplement the state-required budget format as\nnecessary for these purposes.\nWhenever revenues and expenditures change significantly throughout the year, the Superintendent or designee shall\nrecommend budget amendments to ensure accurate projections of the district's net ending balance. When final\nfigures for the prior-year budget are available, this information shall be used as soon as possible to update the\ncurrent-year budget's beginning balance and projected revenues and expenditures. In addition, budget amendments\nshall be submitted for Board approval when the state budget is adopted, collective bargaining agreements are\naccepted, district income declines, increased revenues or unanticipated savings are made available to the district,\nprogram proposals are significantly different from those approved during budget adoption, and/or other significant\nchanges occur that impact budget projections.",

(2 CFR 200.77, 200.308, 200.309, 200.343)\nProcurement\nWhen procuring goods and services with a federal grant, the Superintendent or designee shall comply with the standards\ncontained in 2 CFR 200.317-200.326 and Appendix II of Part 200, or with any applicable state law or district policy that is\nmore restrictive.\nAs appropriate to encourage greater economy and efficiency, the Superintendent or designee shall avoid acquisition of\nunnecessary or duplicative items, give consideration to consolidating or breaking out procurements, analyze lease versus\npurchase alternatives, consider entering into an interagency agreement for procurement of common or shared goods and\nservices, and/or use federal excess or surplus property. (2 CFR 200.318)\nThe procurement of goods or services with federal funds shall be conducted in a manner that provides full and open\ncompetition in accordance with state laws and district regulations and the following requirements:\n1. Any purchase of supplies or services that does not exceed the \"micro-purchase\" threshold speci\ufb01ed in 48 CFR 2.101\nmay be awarded without soliciAng compeAAve quotes, provided that the district considers the price to be reasonable\nand maintains written evidence of this reasonableness in the record of all micro-purchases. (2 CFR 200.67, 200.320)\n2. For any purchase that exceeds the micro-purchase threshold but is less than the bid limit required by Public Contract\nCode 20111, the Superintendent or designee shall uAlize \"small-purchase\" procedures that include obtaining price or\nrate quotes from an adequate number of qualified sources. (2 CFR 200.320)\n3. Contracts for goods or services over the bid limits required by Public Contract Code 20111 shall be awarded pursuant\nto California law and AR 3311 - Bids, unless exempt from bidding under the law.\n4. If a purchase is exempt from bidding and the district's solicitaAon is by a request for proposals, the award may be\nmade by either a \ufb01xed-price or cost-reimbursement type contract awarded to the enAty whose proposal is most\nadvantageous to the program, with price and other factors considered. (2 CFR 200.320)\n5. Procurement by noncompeAAve proposals (sole sourcing) may be used only when the item is available exclusively\nfrom a single source, the need or emergency will not permit a delay resulAng from compeAAve solicitaAon, the\nawarding agency expressly authorizes sole sourcing in response to the district's request, and/or compeAAon is \ndetermined inadequate after solicitation of a number of sources. (2 CFR 200.320)\n6. Time and materials type contracts may be used only aBer a determinaAon that no other contract is suitable and if the\ncontract includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. Time and materials type contract means a\ncontract for which the cost is the sum of the actual cost of materials and direct labor hours charged at \ufb01xed hourly\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nrates that reflect wages, general administrative expenses, and profit. (200.328)\nFor any purchase of $25,000 or more, the Superintendent or designee shall verify that any vendor which is used to procure\ngoods or services is not excluded or disqualified by the federal government. (2 CFR 180.220, 200.213)\nAll solicitations shall incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or\nservice to be procured. Such description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict\ncompetition. The description shall avoid detailed product specifications to the extent possible, but may include a statement of\nthe qualitative nature of the material, product, or service to be procured and, when necessary, shall set forth those minimum\nessential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. When it is impractical or not\neconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a brand name or equivalent description\nmay be used to define the performance or other salient requirements of procurement, clearly stating the specific features of\nthe named brand which must be met by offers. In addition, every solicitation shall identify all requirements which the offer\nmust fulfill and any other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals. (2 CFR 200.319)\nThe Superintendent or designee shall maintain sufficient records to document the procurement, including, but not limited to,\nthe rationale for the method of procurement, selection of the contract type, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis\nfor the contract price. (2 CFR 200.318)\nThe Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all contracts for purchases using federal grant funds contain the applicable\ncontract provisions described in Appendix II to Part 200 - Contract Provisions for Non-Federal Entity Contracts Under\nFederal Awards. (2 CFR 200.326)\nCapital Expenditures\nThe Superintendent or designee shall obtain prior written approval from the awarding agency before using federal funds to\nmake capital expenditures, including the acquisition of land, facilities, equipment, and intellectual property and expenditures\nto make additions, improvements, modifications, replacements, rearrangements, reinstallations, renovations, or alterations to\ncapital assets that materially increase their value or useful life. (2 CFR 200.12, 200.13, 200.20, 200.33, 200.48, 200.58,\n200.89, 200.313, 200.439)\nConflict of Interest\nNo Governing Board member, district employee, or district representative shall participate in the selection, award, or\nadministration of a contract supported by federal funds if he/she has a real or apparent conflict of interest, such as when\nhe/she or a member of his/her immediate family, his/her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any\nof them has a financial interest in or a tangible personal benefit from a firm considered for a contract. Such persons are\nprohibited from soliciting or accepting gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or subcontractors\nunless the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. (2 CFR 200.318)\nEmployees engaged in the selection, award, and administration of contracts shall also comply with BB 9270 - Conflict of\nInterest.\nPersons involved in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by federal funds shall be subject to\ndiscipline for any violation of conflict of interest standards. (2 CFR 200.318)\nCash Management\nThe Superintendent or designee shall ensure the district's compliance with 2 CFR 200.305 pertaining to payments and cash\nmanagement, including compliance with applicable methods and procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the\ntransfer of funds to the district and the district's disbursement of funds. (2 CFR 200.305)\nWhen authorized by law, the district may receive advance payments of federal grant funds, limited to the minimum amounts\nneeded and timed in accordance with the actual immediate cash requirements of the district for carrying out the purpose of\nthe program or project. Except under specified conditions, the district shall maintain the advance payments in an interest-\nbearing account. The district shall remit interest earned on the advanced payment to the awarding agency on an annual basis,\nbut may retain interest amounts specified in 2 CFR 200.305 for administrative expenses. (2 CFR 200.305)\nWhen required by the awarding agency, the district shall instead submit a request for reimbursement of actual expenses\nincurred. The district may also request reimbursement as an alternative to receiving advance payments. (2 CFR 200.305)\nThe Superintendent or designee shall maintain source documentation supporting the expenditure of federal funds, such as\ninvoices, time sheets, payroll stubs, or other appropriate documentation.\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nPersonnel\nAll district employees who are paid in full or in part with federal funds shall document the amount of time they spend on\ngrant activities. Such records shall be incorporated into the official records of the district and shall be subject to a system of\ninternal controls which provides reasonable assurance that the charges are accurate, allowable, and properly allocated in\naccordance with 2 CFR 200.430. (2 CFR 200.430)\nEmployees whose salary is paid with state or local funds but are used to meet a cost-sharing or required match or in-kind\ncontribution of the federal grant shall be documented in the same manner as salaries and wages claimed for reimbursement\nunder a federal grant. (2 CFR 200.430)\nRecords\nExcept as otherwise provided in 2 CFR 200.333, or where state law or district policy requires a longer retention period,\nfinancial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other district records related to a federal award shall be\nretained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for a federal award that is\nrenewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report. (2 CFR 200.333)\nAudits\nWhenever the district expends $750,000 or more in federal grant funds during a fiscal year, it shall arrange for either a single\naudit or a program-specific audit in accordance with 2 CFR 200.507 or 200.514. (2 CFR 200.501)\nThe Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the audit meets the requirements specified in 2 CFR 200.500-200.521.\nSpecified records pertaining to the audit of federal funds expended by the district shall be transmitted to the clearinghouse\ndesignated by the federal Office of Management and Budget and shall be made available for public inspection. Such records\nshall be transmitted within 30 days after receipt of the auditor's report or within nine months after the end of the audit\nperiod, whichever is sooner, unless a longer period is agreed to in advance by the federal agency or a different period is\nspecified in a program-specific audit guide. (2 CFR 200.512)\nIn the event that the audit identifies any deficiency, the Superintendent or designee shall promptly act to either correct the\nidentified deficiency, produce recommended improvements, or demonstrate that the audit finding is invalid or does not\nwarrant action.

The Superintendent or designee shall periodically study the current and projected use of all district\nfacilities to ensure the efficient utilization of space for the effective delivery of instruction.\nPrior to the sale or lease of any surplus real property, the Board shall appoint a district advisory committee to advise\nthe Board regarding the use or disposition of schools or school building space which is not needed for school\npurposes. The Board may elect not to appoint a district advisory committee for any of the following: (Education\nCode 17388, 17391)\n1. A rental of property for a period of time not exceeding 30 days\n2. A lease or rental of surplus property to a private educational institution for the purpose of offering summer\nschool\n3. A sale, lease, or rental of surplus property to be used for teacher or other employee housing\nIn addition, to ensure that the proposed disposition of the property conforms with any general plan adopted by the\nlocal planning agency that affects or includes the area where the surplus property is located, the Board shall submit a\nreport to the local planning agency describing the location of the surplus property and the purpose and extent of the\nproposed sale or lease. (Government Code 65402)\nThe Board shall determine whether the sale or lease of the surplus property is subject to review under the California\nEnvironmental Quality Act. (Public Resources Code 21000-21177; 14 CCR 15061-15062)\nThe Board may meet in closed session with its real property negotiator prior to the sale or lease of real property by\nthe district in order to grant its negotiator authority regarding the minimum price or rent and terms of the sale or\nlease. (Government Code 54956.8)\nBefore taking action to dispose of any land, the Board shall declare, at a regular meeting, supported by written\nfindings that, under the Surplus Land Act, the land is either (1) surplus land or (2) exempt surplus land. (Government\nCode 54221)\nHowever, if the land involved is exempt surplus land as specified in Government Code 54221(f)(1), the Board, at its\ndiscretion, may decide not to make such a declaration. Instead of the declaration, the Board may identify the land as\nexempt surplus land in a notice that is published and available for public comment and to the entities identified in\nGovernment Code 54222 at least 30 days before the exemption takes effect. (Government Code 54221)\nAdditionally, at least 30 days prior to disposing of exempt surplus land, the district shall provide the Department of\nHousing and Community Development (HCD) a copy of the Board's declarations and findings supporting the Board's\ndetermination that the land is exempt surplus land using the form prescribed by HCD. (Government Code 54221)\nIf the district has received notification from HCD that the district has violated the Surplus Land Act pursuant to\nGovernment Code 54230.5, the Board shall not pursue a final action to ratify or approve the proposed disposal of\nsurplus land unless the Board holds an open and public meeting in compliance with Government Code 54230.7 to\nreview and consider the substance of the notice.\nWhen selling or leasing district real property, the Board shall comply with applicable procedures and give priority to\nspecified public agencies as required by law. (Education Code 17230, 17464, 17485-17500; Government Code\n54221-54234)\nResolution of Intention to Sell or Lease\nBefore ordering the sale or lease of any real property, the Board shall adopt a resolution by a two-thirds vote of all of\nits members at a regularly scheduled open meeting. The resolution shall describe the property proposed to be sold or\nleased in such a manner as to identify it, specify the minimum price or rent, describe the terms upon which it will be\nsold or leased, and specify the commission or rate, if any, which the Board will pay to a licensed real estate broker\nout of the minimum price or rent. The resolution shall fix a time, not less than three weeks thereafter, for a public\nmeeting, held at the Board's regular meeting place, at which sealed proposals to purchase or lease will be received\nand considered. (Education Code 17466)\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nThe Superintendent or designee shall provide notice of the adoption of the resolution and of the time and place of\nthe meeting that will be held to consider bids by posting copies of the resolution, signed by the Board, in three public\nplaces not less than 15 days before the date of the meeting. In addition, the notice shall be published at least once a\nweek for three successive weeks before the meeting, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county in\nwhich the district is located, if such a newspaper exists. (Education Code 17469)\nAt least 60 days prior to the public meeting, the Superintendent or designee shall take reasonable steps to provide\nwritten notification of the public meeting, by certified mail, to the former owner from whom the district acquired the\nproperty. (Education Code 17470)\nAcceptance/Rejection of Bids\nAt the public meeting specified in the resolution of intention to sell or lease property, the Board shall open, examine,\nand declare all sealed bids. Before accepting a written proposal, the Board shall call for oral bids in accordance with\nlaw. (Education Code 17472, 17473)\nThe Board may reject any and all bids, either written or oral, and withdraw the properties from sale when the Board\ndetermines that rejection is in the best public interest. If no proposals are submitted or the submitted proposals do\nnot conform to all the terms and conditions specified in the resolution of intention to lease, the Board may lease the\nproperty in accordance with Education Code 17477. (Education Code 17476, 17477)\nOf the proposals submitted by responsible bidders which conform to all terms and conditions specified in the\nresolution of intention to sell or lease, the Board shall finally accept the highest bid after deducting the commission,\nif any, to be paid to a licensed real estate broker, unless the Board accepts a higher oral bid or rejects all bids. \n(Education Code 17472)\nThe final acceptance of the bid may be made either at the same meeting specified in the resolution or at any\nadjourned/continued meeting held within 10 days. Upon acceptance of the bid, the Board may adopt a resolution of\nacceptance that directs the Board president, or any other Board member, to execute the deed or lease and to deliver\nthe document upon performance and compliance by the successful bidder of all of the terms and conditions of the\ncontract. (Education Code 17472-17478)\nUse of Proceeds\nThe Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the proceeds from the sale or lease with an option to purchase of\nsurplus district property are used for one-time expenditures and not for ongoing expenditures such as salaries and\ngeneral operating expenses. (Education Code 17462; 2 CCR 1700)\nProceeds from a sale of surplus district property shall generally be used for capital outlay or maintenance costs that\nthe Board determines will not recur within a five-year period. Proceeds from a lease of district property with an\noption to purchase may be deposited into a restricted fund for the routine repair of district facilities, as defined by\nthe State Allocation Board (SAB), for up to a five-year period. (Education Code 17462)\nHowever, if the Board and SAB determine that the district has no anticipated need for additional sites or building\nconstruction for the next 10 years and no major deferred maintenance requirements, the proceeds from the sale or\nlease with an option to purchase may be deposited in a special reserve fund for the future maintenance and\nrenovation of school sites or in the district's general fund. (Education Code 17462)\nWhenever the district sells real property that was purchased, improved, or modernized with funds that were\nreceived from a state school facilities funding program within the previous 10 years, the district shall notify OPSC\nwithin 90 calendar days of the sale of the property if the proceeds from the sale are not used for capital outlay and\nthe property is not sold to a charter school, another school district, a county office of education, or an agency that\nwill use the property exclusively for the delivery of child care and development services. If SAB subsequently makes\na finding that the sale is subject to Education Code 17462.3, the district shall return the funds to the SAB within 90\ncalendar days of the finding. (2 CCR 1702)",

      "content": "This Debt Issuance and Management Policy provides a framework for debt management and capital planning by the\nRedwood City School District.\nThe Board of Education is committed to long-term capital and financial planning and recognizes that the issuance of\ndebt is a key source for funding the improvement and maintenance of school facilities and managing cash flow. Any\ndebt issued by the district shall be consistent with law and this policy.\nThe district shall not enter into indebtedness or liability that in any year exceeds the income and revenue provided\nfor such year, unless two-thirds of the voters approve the obligation or one of the exceptions specified in law\napplies. (California Constitution, Article 16, Section 18).\nWhen the Board determines that it is in the best interest of the district, the Board may issue debt or order an\nelection to issue debt. The Superintendent or designee shall make recommendations to the Board regarding\nappropriate financing methods for capital projects or other projects that are authorized purposes for debt issuance.\nWhen approved by the Board and/or the voters as applicable, the Superintendent or designee shall administer and\ncoordinate the district's debt issuance program and activities, including the timing of issuance, sizing of issuance,\nmethod of sale, structuring of the issue, and marketing strategies.\nFinancial Advisors\nThe Superintendent or designee shall retain a financial advisor, municipal advisor, investment advisor, and other\nfinancial services professionals as needed to assist with the structuring of the debt issuance and to provide general\nadvice on the district's debt management program, financing options, investments, and compliance with legal\nrequirements. Contracts for services provided by such advisors may be for a single transaction or for multiple\ntransactions, consistent with the contracting requirements in Education Code 17596. In the event that the district\nissues debt through a negotiated sale, underwriters may be selected for multiple transactions if multiple issuances\nare planned for the same project. In addition, the district shall select a legal team on an as-needed basis to assist with\ndebt issuances or special projects.\nGoals of Debt Issuance and Management Policy\nThe district's debt issuance activities and procedures shall be aligned with the district's vision and goals for providing\nadequate facilities and programs that support student learning and well-being. When issuing debt, the district shall\nensure that it:\n1. Maintains accountability for the fiscal health of the district, including prudent management and transparency of\nthe district's financing programs\n \n2. If applicable, pursues the best possible credit rating for each debt issue in order to reduce interest costs, within\nthe context of preserving financial flexibility and meeting capital funding requirements\n \n3. Takes all practical precautions and proactive measures to avoid any financial decision that will negatively\nimpact current credit ratings on existing or future debt issues\n \n4. Maintains effective communication with rating agencies and, as appropriate, credit enhancers such as bond\ninsurers or other providers of credit or liquidity instruments in order to enhance the creditworthiness, liquidity,\nor marketability of the debt\n \n5. Monitors the district's statutory debt limit in relation to assessed valuation within the district and the tax\nburden needed to meet long-term debt service requirements\n \n6. When determining the timing of debt issuance, considers market conditions, cash flows associated with\nrepayment, and the district's ability to expend the obtained funds in a timely, efficient, and economical manner\nconsistent with federal tax laws\n \n7. Determines the amortization (maturity) schedule which will fit best within the overall debt structure of the\ndistrict at the time the new debt is issued\n \nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\n8. Considers the useful lives of assets funded by the debt issue, as well as repair and replacement costs of those\nassets to be incurred in the future\n \n9. Preserves the availability of the district's general fund for operating purposes and other purposes that cannot\nbe funded by the issuance of voter-approved debt\n \n10. Meets the ongoing obligations and accountability requirements associated with the issuance and management\nof debt under state and federal tax and securities laws\nAuthorized Purposes for the Issuance of Debt\nThe district may issue debt for any of the following purposes:\n1. To pay for the cost of capital improvements, including acquiring, constructing, reconstructing, rehabilitating,\nreplacing, improving, extending, enlarging, and/or equipping district facilities\n \n2. To refund existing debt\n \n3. To provide for cash flow needs\nOperating Cash Flow\nPursuant to Government Code 53854, general operating costs, including, but not limited to, items normally funded in\nthe district's annual operating budget, shall not be financed from debt payable later than 15 months from the date of\nissuance. The district may deem it desirable to finance cash flow requirements under certain conditions so that\navailable resources better match expenditures within a given fiscal year. To satisfy both state constitutional and\nstatutory constraints, such cash flow borrowing shall be payable from taxes, income, revenue, cash receipts, and\nother moneys attributable to the fiscal year in which the debt is issued.\nAuthorized Types of Debt\nThe Superintendent or designee shall recommend to the Board potential financing method(s) that result in the\nhighest benefit to the district, with the cost of staff and consultants considered. Potential financing sources may\ninclude:\n1. Short-Term Debt\n \na. Short-term debt, such as tax and revenue anticipation notes (TRANs), when necessary to allow the\ndistrict to meet its cash flow requirements (Government Code 53850-53858)\n \nb. Bond anticipation notes (BANs) to provide interim financing for capital bond projects that will ultimately\nbe paid from general obligation bonds (Education Code 15150)\n \nc. Grant anticipation notes (GANs) to provide interim financing pending the receipt of grants and/or loans\nfrom the state or federal government that have been appropriated and committed to the district\n(Government Code 53859-53859.08)\n \n2. Long-Term Debt\n \na. General obligation bonds for projects approved by voters (California Constitution, Article 13A, Section 1;\nEducation Code 15100-15262, 15264- 15276; Government Code 53506-53509.5)\n \nb. Special tax bonds issued pursuant to the Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982 (Government\nCode 53311-53368.3)\n \n3. Lease financing, including certificates of participation (COPs) and lease revenue bonds\n \na. Lease financing to fund the highest priority capital equipment purchases when pay-as-you-go financing\nis not feasible (Education Code 17450-17453.1)\n \nb. Lease financing to fund facilities projects when there is insufficient time to obtain voter approval or in\ninstances where obtaining voter approval is either not feasible or unavailable (Education Code\n17400-17429)\n\n4. Special financing programs or structures offered by the federal or state government, such as Qualified Zone\nAcademy Bonds or other tax credit obligations or obligations that provide subsidized interest payments, when\nthe use of such programs or structures is determined to result in sufficiently lower financing costs compared to\ntraditional tax-exempt bonds and/or COPs or revenue bonds\n \n5. Temporary borrowing from other sources such as the County Treasurer\nCOPs, TRANs, revenue bonds, or any other non-voter approved debt instrument shall not be issued by the district in\nany fiscal year in which the district has a qualified or negative certification, unless the County Superintendent of\nSchools determines, pursuant to criteria established by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, that the district's\nrepayment of that indebtedness is probable. (Education Code 42133)\nRelationship of Debt to District Facilities Program and Budget\nDecisions regarding the issuance of debt for the purpose of financing capital improvement shall be aligned with\ncurrent needs for acquisition, development, and/or improvement of district property and facilities as identified in the\ndistrict's facilities master plan or other applicable needs assessment, the projected costs of those needs, schedules\nfor the projects, and the expected resources.\nThe cost of debt issued for major capital repairs or replacements shall be evaluated against the potential cost of\ndelaying such repairs and/or replacing such facilities.\nWhen considering a debt issuance, the Board and the Superintendent or designee shall evaluate both the short-term\nand long-term implications of the debt issuance and additional operating costs associated with the new projects\ninvolved. Such evaluation may include, but is not limited to, the projected ratio of annual debt service to the tax\nburden on the district's taxpayers and the ratio of annual debt service secured by the general fund to general fund\nexpenditures.\nThe district may enter into credit enhancement agreements such as municipal bond insurance, surety bonds, letters\nof credit, and lines of credit with commercial banks, municipal bond insurance companies, or other financial entities\nwhen their use is judged to lower borrowing costs, eliminate restrictive covenants, or have a net economic benefit to\nthe financing.\nStructure of Debt Issues\nThe district shall consider the overall impact of the current and future debt burden of the financing when\ndetermining the duration of the debt issue.\nThe district shall design the financing schedule and repayment of debt so as to take best advantage of market\nconditions, ensure cost effectiveness, provide flexibility, and, as practical, recapture or maximize its debt capacity for\nfuture use. Principal amortization will be structured to meet debt repayment, tax rate, and flexibility goals.\nFor new money debt issuances for capital improvements, the district shall size the debt issuance with the aim of\nfunding capital projects as deemed appropriate by the Board, as long as the issuance is consistent with the overall\nfinancing plan, does not exceed the amount authorized by voters, and, unless a waiver is sought and received from\nthe state, will not cause the district to exceed the limitation on debt issuances specified in the California Constitution\nor Education Code 15106.\nTo the extent practicable, the district shall also consider credit issues, market factors, and tax law when sizing the\ndistrict's bond issuance. The sizing of refunding bonds shall be determined by the amount of money that will be\nrequired to cover the principal of, any accrued interest on, and any redemption premium for the debt to be paid on\nthe call date and to cover appropriate financing costs.\nAny general obligation bond issued by the district shall mature within 40 years of the issuance date or as otherwise\nrequired by law. (California Constitution, Article 16, Section 18; Government Code 53508.6)\nThe final maturity of equipment or real property lease obligations will be limited to the useful life of the assets to be\nfinanced but, with respect to a lease purchase of equipment, no longer than a period of 10 years. (Education Code\n17452)\nMethod of Sale\nFor the sale of any district-issued debt, the Superintendent or designee shall recommend the method of sale with the\n\npotential to achieve the lowest financing cost and/or to generate other benefits to the district. Potential methods of\nsale include:\n1. A competitive bidding process through which the award is based on, among other factors, the lowest offered\ntrue interest cost\n \n2. Negotiated sale, subject to approval by the district to ensure that interest costs are in accordance with\ncomparable market interest rates\n \n3. Private placement sale, when the financing can or must be structured for a single or limited number of\npurchasers or where the terms of the private placement are more beneficial to the district than either a\nnegotiated or competitive sale\nInvestment of Proceeds\nThe district shall actively manage the proceeds of debt issued for public purposes in a manner that is consistent with\nstate law governing the investment of public funds and with the permitted securities covenants of related financing\ndocuments executed by the district. Where applicable, the district's official investment policy and legal documents\nfor a particular debt issuance shall govern specific methods of investment of bond-related proceeds. Preservation of\nprincipal shall be the primary goal of any investment strategy, followed by the availability of funds and then by return\non investment.\nWith regard to general obligation bonds, the district shall invest new money bond proceeds in the county treasury\npool as required by law. (Education Code 15146)\nThe management of public funds shall enable the district to respond to changes in markets or changes in payment or\nconstruction schedules so as to ensure liquidity and minimize risk.\nRefunding/Restructuring\nThe district may consider refunding or restructuring outstanding debt if it will be financially advantageous or\nbeneficial for debt repayment and/or structuring flexibility. When doing so, the district shall consider the\nmaximization of the district's expected net savings over the life of the debt issuance and, when using a general\nobligation bond to refund an existing bond, shall ensure that the final maturity of the refunding bond is no longer\nthan the final maturity of the existing bond.\nInternal Controls\nThe Superintendent or designee shall establish internal control procedures to ensure that the proceeds of any debt\nissuance are directed to the intended use. Such procedures shall assist the district in maintaining the effectiveness\nand efficiency of operations, properly expending funds, reliably reporting debt incurred by the district and the use of\nthe proceeds, complying with all laws and regulations, preventing fraud, and avoiding conflict of interest.\nThe district shall be vigilant in using bond proceeds in accordance with the stated purposes at the time such debt was\nincurred as defined in the text of the voter-approved bond measure. (Government Code 53410)\nWhen feasible, the district shall issue debt with a defined revenue source in order to preserve the use of the general\nfund for general operating purposes.\nThe district shall annually conduct a due diligence review to ensure its compliance with all ongoing obligations\napplicable to issuers of debt. Such a review may be conducted by general legal counsel or bond counsel. Any district\npersonnel involved in conducting such reviews shall receive periodic training regarding their responsibilities.\nIn addition, the Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district completes, as applicable, all performance\nand financial audits that may be required for any debt issued by the district, including disclosure requirements\napplicable to a particular transaction.\nRecords/Reports\nAt least 30 days prior to the sale of any debt issue, the Superintendent or designee shall submit a report of the\nproposed issuance to the California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission (CDIAC). Such report shall include a\nself-certification that the district has adopted a policy concerning the use of debt that complies with law and that the\ncontemplated debt issuance is consistent with that policy. (Government Code 8855)\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nOn or before January 31 of each year, the Superintendent or designee shall submit a report to the CDIAC regarding\nthe debt authorized, the debt outstanding, and the use of proceeds of the issued debt for the period from July 1 to\nJune 30. (Government Code 8855)\nThe Superintendent or designee shall provide initial and any annual or ongoing disclosures required by 17 CFR\n240.10b-5 and 240.15c2-12 to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, investors, and other persons or entities\nentitled to disclosure, and shall ensure that the district's disclosure filings are updated as needed.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall maintain transaction records of decisions made in connection with each debt\nissuance, including the selection of members of the financing team, the structuring of the financing, selection of\ncredit enhancement products and providers, and selection of investment products. Each transaction file shall include\nthe official transcript for the financing, interest rates and cost of issuance on the day when the debt was sold (\"final\nnumber runs\"), and a post-pricing summary of the debt issue. In addition, documentation evidencing the expenditure\nof proceeds, the use of debt-financed property by public and private entities, all sources of payment or security for\nthe debt, and investment of proceeds shall be kept for as long as the debt is outstanding, plus the period ending\nthree years after the financial payment date of the debt or the final payment date of any obligations or series of\nbonds issued to refund directly or indirectly all of any portion of the debt, whichever is later.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the Board regarding debts issued by the district, including\ninformation on actual and projected tax rates, an analysis of bonding capacity, ratings on the district's bonds, market\nupdate and refunding opportunities, new development for California bond financings, and the district's compliance\nwith post-issuance requirements.",

      "content": "Definition\nIntegrated Pest Management (IPM) means a strategy that focuses on long-term prevention or suppression of pest\nproblems through a combination of techniques such as monitoring for pest presence and establishing treatment\nthreshold levels, using nonchemical practices to make the habitat less conducive to pest development, improving\nsanitation, and employing mechanical and physical controls. Pesticides that pose the least possible hazard and are\neffective in a manner that minimizes risks to people, property, and the environment are used only after careful\nmonitoring indicates they are needed according to pre-established guidelines and treatment thresholds. (Food and\nAgricultural Code 13181)\nProcedures\nThe Superintendent or designee shall designate a staff person to develop, implement, and coordinate an IPM\nprogram that incorporates effective, least toxic pest management practices. The district's program shall include the\nfollowing elements:\n1. Carefully monitoring and identifying the pest population levels and identifying practices that could affect pest\npopulations. Strategies for managing the pest shall be influenced by the pest species and whether that species\nposes a threat to people, property, or the environment.\n \n2. Setting action threshold levels to determine when pest populations or vegetation at a specific location might\ncause unacceptable health or economic hazard that would indicate corrective action should be taken.\n \n3. Modifying or eliminating pest habitats to deter pest populations and minimize pest infestations.\n \n4. Considering a full range of possible alternative treatments. Such alternative treatments may include taking no\naction or controlling the pest by physical, horticultural, or biological methods. Cost or staffing considerations\nalone will not be adequate justification for use of chemical control agents.\n \n5. Selecting nonchemical pest management methods over chemical methods whenever such methods are\neffective in providing the desired control or, when it is determined that chemical methods must be used, giving\npreference to those chemicals that pose the least hazard to people and the environment.\n \n6. Ensuring that persons applying pesticides follow label precautions and are trained in the principles and\npractices of IPM.\n \n7. Limiting pesticide purchases to amounts needed for the year. Pesticides shall be stored at a secure location\nthat is not accessible to students and unauthorized staff. They shall be stored and disposed of in accordance\nwith state regulations and label directions registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as\nwell as any disposal requirements indicated on the product label.\nProhibited Pesticides\nThe IPM Coordinator shall not use a pesticide on a school site if that pesticide has been granted a conditional or\ninterim registration or an experimental use permit by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) or if\nthe pesticide is subject to an experimental registration issued by the EPA and either of the following conditions\nexists: (Education Code 17610.1)\n1. The pesticide contains a new active ingredient.\n \n2. The pesticide is for new use.\nIn addition, the IPM Coordinator shall not use a pesticide on a school site if DPR cancels or suspends registration or\nrequires that the pesticide be phased out from use. (Education Code 17610.1)\nNotifications\nThe IPM Coordinator shall annually notify staff and parents/guardians of students enrolled at a school site, in writing,\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nregarding pesticide products expected to be applied at the school facility in the upcoming year. The notification shall\ninclude at least the following: (Education Code 17612)\n1. The Internet address (http://www.schoolipm.info) used to access information on pesticides and pesticide use\nreduction developed by the DPR pursuant to Food and Agricultural Code 13184.\n \n2. The name of each pesticide product expected to be applied in the upcoming year and the active ingredient(s) in\nit.\n \n3. An opportunity for interested persons to register to receive notification of individual pesticide application at\nthe school site. The IPM Coordinator shall notify such registered persons of individual pesticide applications at\nleast 72 hours prior to the application. The notice shall include the product name, the active ingredient(s) in the\nproduct, and the intended date of application.\n \n4.

The applicant shall submit to the district a\ncertificate signed by the examining licensed physician indicating that he/she is free of active tuberculosis. (Education\nCode 49406; 5 CCR 5503)\nThe cost of the pre-employment tuberculosis examination shall be paid by the applicant.\nAn applicant who was previously employed in another California school district may fulfill the tuberculosis\nexamination requirement by either producing a certificate showing that he/she was examined within the last four\nyears and found to be free of active tuberculosis or by having his/her previous school district employer verify that it\nhas on file a certificate which contains that evidence. (Education Code 49406)\nOnce hired by the district, employees who test negative on the initial intradermal or other tuberculin test shall\nundergo a tuberculosis examination at least once every four years, or more often if so directed by the Board of\nEducation upon recommendation of the county health officer, for as long as the employee's test remains negative.\nAn employee with a documented positive test for tuberculosis infection shall no longer be required to submit to the\nexamination and shall be referred to the county health officer within 30 days of the examination to determine the\nneed for follow-up care. (Education Code 49406)\nTuberculosis tests for employees shall be provided at district expense up to a maximum of $120.00. (Education Code\n44839, 45122, 49406)\nIf an employee's religious belief prevents him/her from undergoing a tuberculosis examination, the employee shall\nfile an affidavit stating that he/she adheres to the faith or teachings of a well-recognized religious sect,\ndenomination, or organization and, in accordance with its creed, tenets, or principles, depends for healing upon\nprayer in the practice of religion and that to the best of his/her knowledge or belief he/she is free from active\ntuberculosis. In order to exempt the individual, the Board shall determine by resolution, after a hearing, that the\nhealth of students would not be jeopardized. (Education Code 49406)\nThe Superintendent or designee may exempt a pregnant employee from the requirement that a positive tuberculin\ntest be followed by an X-ray of the lungs, for a period not to exceed 60 days following termination of the pregnancy.\n(Education Code 49406)\nMedical Certification for Communicable Diseases for Certificated Employees\nWhen a new employee in a position requiring certification has not previously been employed in such a position in\nCalifornia or a retirant has not previously been employed as a retirant, he/she shall have a medical certificate on file\nwith the district stating that he/she is free from any disabling disease which would render him/her unfit to instruct or\nassociate with children. The certificate shall be completed by a licensed physician and returned to the district by the\nphysician. The medical examination referred to in the certificate must have been conducted within six months of the\ntime when the certificate is filed.

Temporary modified/light-duty assignments may also serve to \nfacilitate the employee's transition back to their regular duties or full-time work. \nAny employee may request a modified or light-duty assignment when he/she has a temporary medical condition which \nprevents the performance of the essential functions of their current assignment or position. The Superintendent or \ndesignee shall determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a suitable temporary position currently exists to \naccommodate the physical restrictions specified by the employee's medical provider.\nAn employee's initial assignment to a temporary modified or light-duty position shall be for a limited duration, not to \nexceed 30 days. At the end of the initial assignment, the employee may request that the Superintendent or designee \nextend the assignment. When requesting any such extension, the employee shall submit documentation from their \nmedical provider verifying that the employee is still temporarily disabled and is not medically able to return to their \nregular assignment. Temporary assignments generally shall not exceed 90 days, but may be extended at the discretion \nof the Superintendent or designee for an additional 90 days upon verification by the employee's medical provider that \nsuch an extension will allow the employee to return to unrestricted regular duties. \nAn employee who rejects a temporary modified/light-duty assignment may be subject to a loss of workers' \ncompensation benefits in accordance with district's insurance policy.",

The RMIs were musculoskeletal injuries that a licensed physician objectively identified and diagnosed.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the ergonomics program be designed to minimize RMIs in\naccordance with law. The program shall be composed of the following components: (8 CCR 5110)\n1. Worksite evaluation\nEach job, process or operation of identical work activity, or a representative number of such jobs, processes or\noperations of identical activities, shall be evaluated for exposures which have caused RMIs.\n \n2. Control of exposures which have caused RMIs\nAny exposures that have caused RMIs shall, in a timely manner, be corrected or, if not capable of being\ncorrected, be minimized to the extent feasible. The district shall consider engineering controls, such as work\nstation redesign, adjustable fixtures or tool redesign, and administrative controls such as job station, work\npacing or work breaks.\n \n3. Training\nEmployees shall be provided training that includes an explanation of:\n \na. The district's program\n \nb. The exposures that have been associated with RMIs\n \nc. The symptoms and consequences of injuries caused by repetitive motion\n \nd. The importance of reporting symptoms and injuries to the employer\n \ne. Methods used by the district to minimize RMIs",

(Education Code 22850-22856; Government Code\n20990-21013)\nEmployment Status\nAbsence for military leave shall not affect the classification of any employee. In the case of a probationary employee, the\nperiod of such absence shall not count as part of service required to obtain permanent status, but shall not be construed as a\nbreak in the continuity of service for any purpose. (Education Code 44800; Military and Veterans Code 395; 20 CFR\n1002.149)\nReinstatement Rights\nAt the conclusion of the military duty, an employee shall be promptly reinstated in the position held at the beginning of the\nleave, at the salary to which the employee would otherwise have been entitled, except under the conditions noted below in\nthis section. (Education Code 44800; Military and Veterans Code 395, 395.2; 38 USC 4304, 4313; 20 CFR 1002.180-\n1002.181)\nAny employee who performs active military duty in time of war, national emergency, or United Nations military or police\noperation has a right to return to the position held prior to the military service, during terminal leave prior to the employee's\ndischarge, separation, or release from the armed forces, or within six months of the employee's release, separation, honorable\ndischarge, or placement on inactive duty. Reinstatement rights shall not be extended to any such employee who fails to\nreturn within 12 months after the first date upon which the employee could terminate or could cause to have terminated\nactive service. (Education Code 44800; Military and Veterans Code 395.1)\nWhen an employee has been on military leave for reasons other than war or national emergency, the time frame for seeking\nreinstatement shall depend on the length of military service as follows: (38 USC 4312; 20 CFR 1002.115, 1002.118)\n1. For a leave of 30 days or fewer, the employee shall report for duty no later than the beginning of the first full work day\nfollowing the completion of the military service plus a period of eight hours of rest following a period for safe\ntransportation to the employee's residence.\n \n2.

For a leave of more than 180 days, the employee shall submit a written or verbal application for reinstatement within\n90 days after the completion of military service.\nWhere an employee's reporting or application for reinstatement within the periods specified in Items #1 and #2 above is\nimpossible or unreasonable through no fault of the employee, the report or application shall be made as soon as possible after\nthe expiration of the period. In the case of Items #2 and #3 where an application is required, the employee's application may\nbe made orally or in writing and need not follow any particular format. (38 USC 4312; 20 CFR 1002.115, 1002.117,\n1002.118)\nAn employee who is hospitalized for, or convalescing from, an illness or injury incurred in or aggravated during the\nperformance of military service shall report for duty or submit an application for reinstatement at the end of the period that is\nnecessary to recover from such illness or injury, but no more than two years after the completion of military service unless\ncircumstances beyond the employee's control make reporting within the two-year period impossible or unreasonable. (38\nUSC 4312; 20 CFR 1002.116)\nUpon receiving an application for reinstatement, the Superintendent or designee shall reinstate the employee as soon as\npracticable under the circumstances of the case, but within a time period not to exceed two weeks, absent unusual\ncircumstances. (20 CFR 1002.181)\nIf the employee's previous position has been abolished, the district shall reinstate the employee in a position of like seniority,\nstatus, and pay, if such position exists, or to a comparable vacant position for which the employee is qualified. (Military and\nVeterans Code 395, 395.1; 38 USC 4313; 20 CFR 1002.192)\nAn employee who fails to report or apply for reinstatement within the appropriate period does not automatically forfeit the\nentitlement to reinstatement but shall be subject to the district's rules and/or practices governing unexcused absences. (38\nUSC 4312)\nThe Superintendent or designee may elect not to reinstate an employee following military leave if any of the following\nconditions exists:\n1. The district's circumstances have so changed as to make such re-employment impossible or unreasonable, such as a\nreduction in force that would have included the employee. (38 USC 4312; 20 CFR 1002.139)\n \n2. The accommodation, training, or effort described in 38 USC 4313(a)(3), (a)(4), or (b)(2)(B) would impose an undue\nhardship on the district as defined in 20 CFR 1002.5 or 1002.198. (38 USC 4312; 20 CFR 1002.139)\n \n3. The employee's position was for a brief, nonrecurrent period and there was no reasonable expectation that such\nemployment will continue indefinitely or for a significant period. (38 USC 4312; 20 CFR 1002.139)\n \n4. The employee's cumulative length of absence and length of all previous military leave while employed with the district\nexceeds five years, excluding those training and service obligations specified in 38 USC 4312(c). (38 USC 4312; 20\nCFR 1002.99-1002.103)\n \n5. The employee was separated from military service with a disqualifying discharge or under other than honorable\nconditions. (Military and Veterans Code 395.1; 20 USC 4304, 4312; 20 CFR 1002.134-1002.138)\nNotices\nThe Superintendent or designee shall provide employees a notice of the rights, benefits, and obligations of employees\ngranted military leave and of the district under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA),\n38 USC 4301-4334. (38 USC 4334)\nThis requirement may be met by posting the notice where the district customarily places notices for employees. (38 USC\n4334)",

The district shall not interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of an \nemployee's right to any such leave, nor shall the district discharge, discriminate against, or retaliate against an employee for taking \nsuch leave, opposing or challenging an unlawful employment practice in relation to any of these laws, or being involved in any \nrelated inquiry or proceeding. (Government Code 12945, 12945.2; 2 CCR 11094; 29 USC 2615)\nDefinitions\nThe words and phrases defined below shall have the same meaning throughout this administrative regulation except where a \ndifferent meaning is otherwise specified.\nChild means a biological, adopted, or foster child; a stepchild; a legal ward; or a person to whom the employee stands in loco \nparentis.

To the extent allowed \nby law, CFRA and FMLA leaves shall run concurrently. (Government Code 12945.2; 29 USC 2612)\nThe 12-month period shall be measured forward from the date the employee's first family care and medical leave begins. (29 CFR \n825.200)\nIn addition, any employee who is disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or other related condition shall be entitled to PDL for the period \nof the disability not to exceed four months. For a part-time employee, the four months shall be calculated on a proportional basis. \n(Government Code 12945; 2 CCR 11042)\nPDL shall run concurrently with FMLA leave for disability caused by an employee's pregnancy. At the end of the employee's FMLA \nleave for disability caused by pregnancy, or at the end of four months of PDL, whichever occurs first, a CFRA-eligible employee \nmay request to take CFRA leave of up to 12 work weeks, for the reason of the birth of a child or to bond with or care for the child. \n(Government Code 12945, 12945.2; 2 CCR 11046, 11093)\nLeave taken for the birth or placement of a child must be concluded within the 12-month period beginning on the date of the birth \nor placement of the child. Such leave does not need to be taken in one continuous period of time. (2 CCR 11090; 29 USC 2612)\nEach eligible employee shall be granted up to 12 work weeks for family care and medical leave related to the birth or placement of \na child, regardless of whether both parents of the child work for the district.\nUse/Substitution of Paid Leave\nDuring any otherwise unpaid period of FMLA or CFRA leave, except leave for an employee's own serious health condition, an \nemployee shall use accrued paid leave, including, but not limited to, vacation leave, personal leave, or family leave. If the leave is for \nthe employee's own serious health condition, the employee shall use accrued paid leave, including but not limited to, vacation \nleave, personal leave, or sick leave. During an unpaid period of PDL, the employee shall use any accrued sick leave and may elect to \nuse any vacation time or other accrued personal time off. (Government Code 12945, 12945.2; 2 CCR 11044, 11092; 29 USC \n2612)\nThe district and employee may also come to agreement regarding the use of any additional paid or unpaid time off instead of using \nthe employee's CFRA leave. (2 CCR 11092)\nIntermittent Leave/Reduced Work or Leave Schedule\nPDL and family care and medical leave for the serious health condition of an employee or eligible family member may be taken \nintermittently or on a reduced work or leave schedule when medically necessary, as determined by the health care provider of the \nperson with the serious health condition. However, the district shall limit leave increments to the shortest period of time that the \ndistrict's payroll system uses to account for absences or use of leave provided it is not to be greater than one hour. (Government \nCode 12945.2; 2 CCR 11042, 11090; 29 USC 2612)\nThe basic minimum duration of leave for the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child shall be two weeks. However, the \ndistrict shall grant a request for such leave of less than two weeks on any two occasions. (2 CCR 11090; 29 USC 2612)\nThe district may require an employee to transfer temporarily to an available alternative position under any of the following \ncircumstances: (2 CCR 11041, 11090; 29 USC 2612)\n1. \n \nThe employee needs intermittent leave or leave on a reduced work schedule that is foreseeable based on a planned medical \ntreatment for the employee or family member\n\n2. \n \nA medical certification is provided by the employee's health care provider that, because of pregnancy, the employee has a \nmedical need to take intermittent leave or leave on a reduced work schedule\n \n \n3. \n \nThe district agrees to permit intermittent leave or leave on a reduced work schedule due to the birth, adoption, or foster \ncare placement of the employee's child\n \nThe alternative position must have equivalent pay and benefits and must better accommodate recurring periods of leave than the \nemployee's regular job, and the employee must be qualified for the position. Transfer to an alternative position may include altering \nan existing job to better accommodate the employee's need for intermittent leave or a reduced work or leave schedule. (2 CCR \n11041, 11090; 29 USC 2612)\nRequest for Leave\nThe district shall consider an employee's request for PDL or family care and medical leave only if the employee provides at least \nverbal notice sufficient to make the district aware of the need to take the leave and the anticipated timing and duration of the \nleave. (2 CCR 11050, 11091)\nFor family care and medical leave, the employee need not expressly assert or mention FMLA/CFRA to satisfy this requirement. \nHowever, the employee must state the reason the leave is needed (e.g., birth of child, medical treatment). If more information is \nnecessary to determine whether the employee is eligible for family care and medical leave, the Superintendent or designee shall \ninquire further and obtain the necessary details of the leave to be taken. (2 CCR 11091)\nThe district shall respond to requests for leave as soon as practicable, but no later than five business days after receiving the \nemployee's request. (2 CCR 11091)\nBased on the information provided by the employee, the Superintendent or designee shall designate the leave, paid or unpaid, as \nFMLA/CFRA qualifying leave and shall give notice of such designation to the employee. Failure of an employee to respond to \npermissible inquiries regarding the leave request may result in denial of CFRA protection if the district is unable to determine \nwhether the leave is CFRA qualifying. (2 CCR 11091; 29 CFR 825.300)\nWhen an employee is able to foresee the need for PDL or family care and medical leave at least 30 days in advance of the leave, \nthe employee shall provide the district with at least 30 days advance notice before the leave. When the 30 days' notice is not \npracticable because of a lack of knowledge of when leave will be required to begin, a change in circumstances, a medical \nemergency, or other good cause, the employee shall provide the district with notice as soon as practicable. Failure of an employee \nto provide required notice may result in a denial of leave. (2 CCR 11050, 11091)\nIn all instances, the employee shall consult with the Superintendent or designee and make a reasonable effort to schedule, subject \nto the health care provider's approval, any planned appointment or medical treatment or supervision so as to minimize disruption to \ndistrict operations. (Government Code 12945.2; 2 CCR 11050, 11091)\nAn eligible employee may request CFRA leave to care for a designated person with a serious health condition. The employee may \nidentify the designated person at the time of the employee's request for the leave. The district may limit an employee to using \nCFRA leave to care for one designated person per 12-month period. (Government Code 12945.2; Labor Code 245.5)\nCertification of Health Condition\nWithin five business days of an employee's request for family care and medical leave for the serious health condition of the \nemployee or an eligible family member, the Superintendent or designee shall request that the employee provide certification by a \nhealth care provider of the need for leave. Upon receiving the district's request, the employee shall provide the certification within \n\n15 calendar days, unless either the Superintendent or designee provides additional time or it is not practicable under the particular \ncircumstances, despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts. (2 CCR 11087, 11091; 29 CFR 825.305)\nThe certification shall include the following: (Government Code 12945.2; 2 CCR 11087; 29 USC 2613)\n1. \n \nThe date on which the serious health condition began\n \n \n2. \n \nThe probable duration of the condition\n \n \n3. \n \nIf the employee is requesting leave to care for an eligible family member with a serious health condition, both of the \nfollowing:\n \n \n \na. \n \nStatement that the serious health condition warrants the participation of the employee to provide care, such as by \nproviding psychological comfort, arranging for third party care, or directly providing or participating in the medical \ncare of the eligible family member during a period of the treatment or supervision\n \n \n \nb. \n \nEstimated amount of time the health care provider believes the employee needs to care for the eligible family \nmember\n \n \n \n \n4. \n \nIf the employee is requesting leave because of the employee's own serious health condition, a statement that due to the \nserious health condition, the employee is unable to work at all or is unable to perform one or more essential job functions of \nthe position\n \n \n5. \n\nIf the employee is requesting leave for intermittent treatment or on a reduced work or leave schedule for planned medical \ntreatment, a statement of the medical necessity for the leave, the dates on which treatment is expected to be given, the \nduration of such treatment, and the expected duration of the leave\n \nThe Superintendent or designee shall not request any genetic information related to an employee except as authorized by law in \naccordance with the California Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2011. (Government Code 12940)\nWhen an employee has provided sufficient medical certification to enable the district to determine whether the employee's leave \nrequest is FMLA/CFRA-eligible, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the employee within five business days whether the \nleave is FMLA/CFRA-eligible. The Superintendent or designee may also retroactively designate leave as FMLA/CFRA leave as long \nas appropriate notice is given to the employee and there is no harm or injury to the employee. (2 CCR 11091; 29 CFR 825.301)\nIf the Superintendent or designee has a good faith objective reason to doubt the validity of a certification that accompanies a \nrequest for leave for the employee's own serious health condition, the Superintendent or designee may require the employee to \nobtain a second opinion from a district-approved health care provider, at district expense. If the second opinion is contrary to the \nfirst, the Superintendent or designee may require the employee to obtain a third medical opinion from a third health care provider \napproved by both the employee and the district, again at district expense. The opinion of the third health care provider shall be final \nand binding. (Government Code 12945.2; 2 CCR 11091; 29 USC 2613)\nCertification for PDL\nThe Superintendent or designee shall request that an employee who is requesting PDL provide certification by a health care \nprovider of the need for leave at the time the employee gives notice of the need for PDL, or within two business days of giving the \nnotice. If the need for PDL is unforeseen, the Superintendent or designee shall request the medical certification within two \nbusiness days after the leave commences. The Superintendent or designee may request certification at some later date if the \nSuperintendent or designee has reason to question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration.

      "content": "Classified Personnel\nThe Governing Board expects all employees to perform their jobs satisfactorily and to exhibit professional and appropriate\nconduct. A classified employee may be disciplined for unprofessional conduct or unsatisfactory performance in accordance\nwith law or any applicable collective bargaining agreement, Board policy, or administrative regulation.\nDisciplinary actions shall be based on the particular facts and circumstances involved and the severity of the employee's\nconduct or performance. An employee's private exercise of personal beliefs and activities, including religious, political,\ncultural, social, or other beliefs or activities, or lack thereof, shall not be grounds for disciplinary action against the employee,\nprovided that the beliefs or activities do not involve coercion of students or any other violation of law, Board policy, or\nadministrative regulation.\nIn addition, an employee shall not be suspended, disciplined, reassigned, transferred, dismissed, or otherwise retaliated\nagainst solely for acting to protect a student engaged in exercising any free speech or press right authorized by, or for\nrefusing to infringe upon a student's conduct protected pursuant to, Education Code 48907 or 48950.\nDisciplinary actions may include, but are not limited to, verbal and written warnings, involuntary reassignment, demotion,\nsuspension without pay, reduction of pay step in class, compulsory leave, and dismissal.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall ensure that disciplinary actions are taken in a consistent, nondiscriminatory manner and\nare appropriately documented.\nDisciplinary actions may include, but are not limited to, verbal and written warnings, involuntary reassignment, demotion,\nsuspension without pay, reduction of pay step in class, compulsory leave, and dismissal.\nA probationary classified employee may be dismissed without cause at any time prior to the expiration of the probationary\nperiod.\nPermanent classified employees shall be subject to disciplinary action only for cause as specified in the accompanying\nadministrative regulation. (Education Code 45113)\nProcedures for Serious Disciplinary Proceedings\nThe Superintendent or designee shall develop disciplinary procedures for use when dismissal, suspension, demotion,\ninvoluntary reassignment, or other serious disciplinary action is contemplated against an employee. The procedures for such\ndiscipline shall include an opportunity for an employee for whom any such disciplinary action is recommended to meet with,\nor respond in writing to, a designated district official (\"Skelly officer\") who will determine whether the recommended\ndiscipline should proceed further or be modified or withdrawn.\nAfter meeting with the employee or considering the employee's written response, if the Skelly officer determines that the\nrecommended discipline should proceed, the Superintendent or designee shall send the employee a notice of the\nrecommended disciplinary action, a statement of charges, and the results of the Skelly hearing. The notice shall include a\nstatement advising the employee of the right to request a Board hearing on the matter.\nIf the employee fails to request a hearing within the time specified in the notice, the employee is deemed to have waived the\nright to do so, and the Board may order the recommended disciplinary action into effect immediately.\nIf a timely request is submitted, a hearing shall be conducted by the Board. (Education Code 45113, 45312)\nThe hearing shall be held at the earliest convenient date, taking into consideration the established schedule of the Board and\nthe availability of legal counsel and witnesses. The employee shall be notified of the time and place of the hearing.\nThe hearing shall be held in closed session, unless the employee requests that the matter be heard in an open session\nmeeting. (Government Code 54957)\nThe employee shall be entitled to appear personally, produce evidence, and be represented by legal counsel.\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nThe Board may use the services of its legal counsel in ruling upon procedural questions, objections to evidence, and issues of\nlaw. The Board may review and consider the records of any prior personnel action proceedings against the employee in\nwhich a disciplinary action was ultimately sustained and any records contained in the employee's personnel files and\nintroduced into evidence at the hearing. The Board shall not be bound by rules of evidence used in California courts.\nInformality in any such hearing shall not invalidate any order or decision made by the Board.\nAt any time before a matter is submitted to the Board for decision, the Superintendent or designee may, with the consent of\nthe Board, serve on the employee and file with the Board an amended or supplemental recommendation of disciplinary\naction. If the amended or supplemental recommendation includes new causes or allegations, the employee shall be afforded a\nreasonable opportunity to prepare a defense. Any new causes or allegations shall be deemed controverted and any\nobjections to the amended or supplemental causes or allegations may be made orally at the hearing and shall be noted on the\nrecord.\nFollowing the hearing or, if the employee has not requested a hearing, after reviewing the Superintendent or designee's\nrecommendation for disciplinary action, the Board shall affirm, modify, or reject the recommended disciplinary action. The\ndecision of the Board shall be in writing and shall contain findings of fact and the disciplinary action approved, if any. The\ndecision of the Board shall be final.\nWithin 10 working days of the Board's final decision, a copy of the decision shall be delivered to the employee and/or\ndesignated representative personally or by registered mail.\nExcept for an allegation of egregious misconduct in which a minor is involved, the Board may delegate the authority to\ndetermine whether sufficient cause exists for disciplinary action to an impartial third-party hearing officer. When the matter\nis heard by a third-party hearing officer, the Board retains the authority to review the determination and to adopt or reject\nthe recommended decision. (Education Code 45113)\nWhen any matter involves an allegation of egregious misconduct as defined in Education Code 44932 and involves a witness\nwho is a minor, the matter shall be referred to an administrative law judge to determine whether sufficient cause exists for\ndisciplinary action against the employee. In such cases, the ruling of the administrative law judge shall be binding on the\ndistrict and the employee. (Education Code 45113)",

A copy of the recommendation shall be served upon the employee either personally or by registered or certified mail,\nreturn receipt requested, at the employee's last known address.\nThe notice shall, in ordinary and concise language, inform the employee of the specific charge(s) or cause(s) for the\ndisciplinary action, the specific acts and omissions upon which the action is based, and, if applicable, the district rule or\nregulation that the employee has allegedly violated. In addition, the notice shall include the employee's right to a hearing on\nthose charges, the time within which the hearing may be requested which shall be not less than five days after service of the\nnotice to the employee, and a card or paper which the employee may sign and file to deny the charges and request a hearing. \n(Education Code 45113, 45116)\nRequest for Board Hearing\nWithin the time specified in the notice of the recommendation of disciplinary action, the employee may request a hearing on\nthe charges by signing and filing the card or paper included with the notice. (Education Code 45113)\nAny other written document signed and appropriately filed within the specified time limit by the employee shall constitute a\nsufficient notice of the request for a hearing. The request shall be delivered to the office of the Superintendent or designee\nduring normal work hours of that office. If mailed to the office of the Superintendent or designee, it must be received or\npostmarked no later than the time limit specified by the district.

The suspension order shall be served upon the employee either personally or by\nregistered or certified mail, return receipt requested, immediately after issuance.\nCompulsory Leave of Absence\nUpon being informed by law enforcement that a classified employee has been charged with a \"mandatory leave of absence\noffense,\" the Superintendent or designee shall immediately place the employee on a leave of absence.

Violation or attempted violation of Penal Code 187 (prohibiting murder or attempted murder)\n \n3. Any offense involving the unlawful sale, use, or exchange to minors of controlled substances as listed in Health and\nSafety Code 11054, 11055, and 11056\nThe Superintendent or designee may place on an immediate compulsory leave of absence a classified employee who is\ncharged with an \"optional leave of absence offense,\" defined as a controlled substance offense specified in Education Code\n44011 and Health and Safety Code 11357-11361, 11363, 11364, and 11370.1 except as it relates to marijuana, mescaline,\npeyote, or tetrahydrocannabinols.\nAn employee's compulsory leave for a mandatory or optional leave of absence offense may extend for not more than 10 days\nafter the entry of judgment in the criminal proceedings. However, the compulsory leave may be extended if the Board gives\nnotice, within 10 days after the entry of judgment in the proceedings, that the employee will be dismissed within 30 days\nfrom the date of service of the notice unless the employee demands a hearing on the dismissal.\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:",

The Board prohibits sexual harassment against district employees and retaliatory behavior or\naction against any person who complains, testifies, or otherwise participates in the complaint process\nestablished for the purpose of this policy.\nSexual harassment includes, but is not limited to, harassment that is based on the sex, gender, gender\nidentity, gender expression, or sexual orientation of the victim and harassment based on pregnancy,\nchildbirth, or related medical conditions.\nThis policy shall apply to all district employees, interns, volunteers, contractors, job applicants, and other\npersons with an employment relationship with the district.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall take all actions necessary to ensure the prevention, investigation, and\ncorrection of sexual harassment, including but not limited to:\n1. Providing training to employees in accordance with law and administrative regulation\n2. Publicizing and disseminating the district's sexual harassment policy to employees and others to\nwhom the policy may apply\n3. Ensuring prompt, thorough, and fair investigation of complaints\n4. Taking timely and appropriate corrective/remedial action(s), which may require interim separation\nof the complainant and the alleged harasser and subsequent monitoring of developments\nThe Superintendent or designee shall periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the district's strategies to\nprevent and address harassment. Such evaluation may involve conducting regular anonymous employee\nsurveys to assess whether harassment is occurring or is perceived to be tolerated, partnering with\nresearchers or other agencies with the needed expertise to evaluate the district's prevention strategies, and\nusing any other effective tool for receiving feedback on systems and/or processes. As necessary, changes\nshall be made to the harassment policy, complaint procedures, or training.\nAll complaints and allegations of sexual harassment shall be kept confidential to the extent necessary to\ncarry out the investigation or to take other subsequent necessary actions. (2 CCR 11023)\nSexual Harassment Reports and Complaints\nAny district employee who feels they have been sexually harassed in the performance of their district\nresponsibilities or who has knowledge of any incident of sexual harassment by or against another employee\nshall immediately report the incident to their direct supervisor, a district administrator, or the district's Title\nIX Coordinator. Employees may bypass their supervisor in filing a complaint if the supervisor is the subject of\nthe complaint. A supervisor or administrator who receives a harassment complaint shall promptly notify the\nTitle IX Coordinator. A supervisor or administrator who receives a harassment complaint shall promptly\nnotify the Title IX coordinator.\nOnce notified, the Title IX Coordinator shall ensure the complaint or allegation is addressed through AR\n4119.12/4219.12/4319.12 - Title IX Sexual Harassment Complaint Procedures or AR 4030 -\nNondiscrimination in Employment as applicable.

      "content": "The complaint procedures described in this administrative regulation shall be used to address any complaint\ngoverned by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 alleging that a district employee, while in an education\nprogram or activity in which a district school exercises substantial control over the context and\nrespondent, was subjected to one or more of the following forms of sexual harassment: (34 CFR 106.30, 106.44)\n1. A district employee conditioning the provision of a district aid, benefit, or service on a person's participation in\nunwelcome sexual conduct\n \n2. Unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive\nthat it effectively denies a person equal access to the district's education program or activity\n \n3. Sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking as defined in 20 USC 1092 or 34 USC 12291\nAll other sexual harassment complaints or allegations shall be investigated and resolved in accordance with AR 4030\n- Nondiscrimination in Employment. The determination of whether the allegations meet the definition\nof sexual harassment under Title IX shall be made by the district's Title IX Coordinator.\nBecause the complainant has a right to pursue a complaint under AR 4030 for any allegation that is dismissed or\ndenied under the Title IX complaint procedure, the Title IX Coordinator shall ensure that all requirements and\ntimelines for AR 4030 are concurrently met while implementing the Title IX procedure.\nReporting Allegations/Filing a Formal Complaint\nAn employee who is the alleged victim of sexual harassment may submit a report of sexual harassment to the\ndistrict's Title IX Coordinator using the contact information listed in AR 4119.11/4219.11/4319.11\n- Sexual Harassment or to the employee's direct supervisor or other district administrator, who shall forward the\nreport to the Title IX Coordinator within one day of receiving the report.\nUpon receiving such a report, the Title IX Coordinator shall inform the complainant of the right to file a formal\ncomplaint and the process for filing a formal complaint.\nA formal complaint, with the complainant's physical or digital signature, may be filed with the Title IX Coordinator in\nperson, by mail, by email, or by any other method authorized by the district. (34 CFR 106.30)\nEven if the alleged victim chooses not to file a formal complaint, the Title IX Coordinator shall file a formal complaint\nin situations when a safety threat exists. In addition, the Title IX Coordinator may file a formal complaint in other\nsituations as permitted under the Title IX regulations, including as part of the district's obligation to not be\ndeliberately indifferent to known allegations of sexual harassment. In such cases, the Title IX Coordinator shall\nprovide the alleged victim notices as required by the Title IX regulations at specific points in the complaint process.\nThe Title IX Coordinator, investigator, decision-maker, or a facilitator of an informal resolution process shall not have\na conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or an individual complainant or\nrespondent. Such persons shall receive training in accordance with 34 CFR 106.45. (34 CFR 106.45)\nSupportive Measures\nUpon receipt of a report of Title IX sexual harassment, the Title IX Coordinator shall promptly contact the\ncomplainant to discuss the availability of supportive measures and shall consider the complainant's wishes with\nrespect to the supportive measures implemented. Supportive measures shall be offered as appropriate, as reasonably\navailable, and without charge to the complainant or the respondent before or after the filing of a formal complaint or\nwhere no formal complaint has been filed. Such measures shall be nondisciplinary, nonpunitive, and not unreasonably\nburden the other party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all parties or the district's educational\nenvironment or to deter sexual harassment. Supportive measures may include, but are not limited to, counseling,\nextensions of deadlines, modifications of work schedules, mutual restrictions on contact, changes in work locations,\nleaves of absence, increased security, and monitoring of certain areas of the campus. (34 CFR 106.30, 106.44)\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nThe district shall maintain as confidential any supportive measures provided to the complainant or respondent, to the\nextent that maintaining such confidentiality would not impair the district's ability to provide the supportive measures.\n(34 CFR 106.30)\nEmergency Removal\nIf a district employee is the respondent, the employee may be placed on administrative leave during the pendency of\nthe formal complaint process. (34 CFR 106.44)\nIf the respondent is a student, the district may, on an emergency basis, remove the student from the district's\neducation program or activity, provided that the district conducts an individualized safety and risk analysis,\ndetermines that removal is justified due to an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or\nother individual arising from the allegations, and provides the student with notice and an opportunity to challenge\nthe decision immediately following the removal. This authority to remove a student does not modify a student's\nrights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. (34 CFR\n106.44)\nDismissal of Complaint\nThe Title IX Coordinator shall dismiss a formal complaint if the alleged conduct would not constitute sexual\nharassment as defined in 34 CFR 106.30 even if proved. The Title IX Coordinator shall also dismiss any complaint in\nwhich the alleged conduct did not occur in the district's education program or activity or did not occur against a\nperson in the United States, and may dismiss a formal complaint if the complainant notifies the district in writing that\nthe complainant would like to withdraw the complaint or any allegations in the complaint, the respondent is no\nlonger employed by the district, or sufficient circumstances prevent the district from gathering evidence sufficient to\nreach a determination with regard to the complaint. (34 CFR 106.45)\nUpon dismissal, the Title IX Coordinator shall promptly send written notice of the dismissal and the reasons for the\ndismissal simultaneously to the parties, and shall inform them of their right to appeal the dismissal of a formal\ncomplaint or any allegation in the complaint in accordance with the appeal procedures described in the section\n\"Appeals\" below. (34 CFR 106.45)\nIf a complaint is dismissed, the conduct may still be addressed pursuant to AR 4030 - Nondiscrimination in\nEmployment as applicable.\nInformal Resolution Process\nWhen a formal complaint of sexual harassment is filed, the district may offer an informal resolution process, such as\nmediation, at any time prior to reaching a determination regarding responsibility. The district shall not require a party\nto participate in the informal resolution process or to waive the right to an investigation and adjudication of a formal\ncomplaint. (34 CFR 106.45)\nThe district may facilitate an informal resolution process provided that the district: (34 CFR 106.45)\n1. Provides the parties with written notice disclosing the allegations, the requirements of the informal resolution\nprocess, the right to withdraw from the informal process and resume the formal complaint process, and any\nconsequences resulting from participating in the informal resolution process, including that records will be\nmaintained or could be shared.\n \n2. Obtains the parties' voluntary, written consent to the informal resolution process\nWritten Notice\nIf a formal complaint is filed, the Title IX Coordinator shall provide the known parties with written notice of the\nfollowing: (34 CFR 106.45)\n1. The district's complaint process, including any informal resolution process\n2. The allegations potentially constituting sexual harassment with sufficient details known at the time, including\nthe identity of parties involved in the incident if known, the conduct allegedly constituting sexual harassment,\nand the date and location of the alleged incident if known. Such notice shall be provided with sufficient time\nfor the parties to prepare a response before any initial interview.\n\nIf, during the course of the investigation, new Title IX allegations arise about the complainant or respondent\nthat are not included in the initial notice, the Title IX Coordinator shall provide notice of the additional\nallegations to the parties.\n \n3. A statement that the respondent is presumed not responsible for the alleged conduct and that a determination\nregarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the complaint process\n \n4. The opportunity for the parties to have an advisor of their choice who may be, but is not required to be, an\nattorney, and the ability to inspect and review evidence\n5. The prohibition against knowingly making false statements or knowingly submitting false information during\nthe complaint process\nThe above notice shall also include the name of the investigator, facilitator of an informal process, and decision-\nmaker and shall inform the parties that, if at any time a party has concerns regarding conflict of interest or bias\nregarding any of these persons, the party should immediately notify the Title IX Coordinator.\nInvestigation Procedures\nDuring the investigation process, the district's designated investigator shall: (34 CFR 106.45)\n1. Provide an equal opportunity for the parties to present witnesses, including fact and expert witnesses, and\nother inculpatory and exculpatory evidence\n2. Not restrict the ability of either party to discuss the allegations under investigation or to gather and present\nrelevant evidence\n3. Provide the parties with the same opportunities to have others present during any grievance proceeding,\nincluding the opportunity to be accompanied to any related meeting or proceeding by the advisor of their\nchoice, who may be, but is not required to be, an attorney\n4. Not limit the choice or presence of an advisor for either the complainant or respondent in any meeting or\ngrievance proceeding, although the district may establish restrictions regarding the extent to which the advisor\nmay participate in the proceedings as long as the restrictions apply equally to both parties\n \n5. Provide, to a party whose participation is invited or expected, written notice of the date, time, location,\nparticipants, and purpose of all investigative interviews or other meetings, with sufficient time for the party to\nprepare to participate\n \n6. Send in an electronic format or hard copy to both parties and their advisors, if any, the evidence obtained as\npart of the investigation that is directly related to the allegations raised in the complaint, and provide the\nparties at least 10 days to submit a written response for the investigator to consider prior to the completion of\nthe investigative report\n \n7. Objectively evaluate all relevant evidence, including both inculpatory and exculpatory evidence, and determine\ncredibility in a manner that is not based on a person's status as a complainant, respondent, or witness\n8. Create an investigative report that fairly summarizes relevant evidence and, at least 10 days prior to the\ndetermination of responsibility, send to the parties and their advisors, if any, the investigative report in an\nelectronic format or a hard copy, for their review and written response\nQuestions and evidence about the complainant's sexual predisposition or prior sexual behavior are not relevant,\nunless such questions and evidence are offered to prove that someone other than the respondent committed the\nconduct alleged by the complainant or if the questions and evidence concern specific incidents of the complainant's\nprior sexual behavior with respect to the respondent and are offered to prove consent. (34 CFR 106.45)\nPrivacy rights of all parties to the complaint shall be maintained in accordance with applicable state and federal laws.\nIf the complaint is against an employee, rights conferred under an applicable collective bargaining agreement shall be\napplied to the extent they do not conflict with the Title IX requirements.\nWritten Decision\n\nThe Superintendent shall designate an employee as the decision-maker to determine responsibility for the alleged\nconduct, who shall not be the Title IX Coordinator or a person involved in the investigation of the matter. (34 CFR\n106.45)\nAfter the investigative report has been sent to the parties but before reaching a determination regarding\nresponsibility, the decision-maker shall afford each party the opportunity to submit written, relevant questions that\nthe party wants asked of any party or witness, provide each party with the answers, and allow for additional, limited\nfollow-up questions from each party\nThe decision-maker shall issue, and simultaneously provide to both parties, a written decision as to whether the\nrespondent is responsible for the alleged conduct. (34 CFR 106.45)\nThe written decision shall be issued within 60 calendar days of the receipt of the complaint.\nThe timeline may be temporarily extended for good cause with written notice to the complainant and respondent of\nthe extension and the reasons for the action. (34 CFR 106.45)\nIn making this determination, the decision-maker shall use the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard for all\nformal complaints of sexual harassment. (34 CFR 106.45)\nThe written decision shall include the following: (34 CFR 106.45) \n1. Identification of the allegations potentially constituting sexual harassment as defined in 34 CFR 106.30\n2. A description of the procedural steps taken from receipt of the formal complaint through the written decision,\nincluding any notifications to the parties, interviews with parties and witnesses, site visits, methods used to\ngather other evidence, and hearings held if the district includes hearings as part of the grievance process\n3. Findings of fact supporting the determination\n4. Conclusions regarding the application of the district's code of conduct or policies to the facts\n5. A statement of, and rationale for, the result as to each allegation, including a decision regarding responsibility,\nany disciplinary sanctions the district imposes on the respondent, and whether remedies designed to restore or\npreserve equal access to the district's educational program or activity will be provided by the district to the\ncomplainant\n6. The district's procedures and permissible bases for the complainant and respondent to appeal\nEither party may appeal the district's decision or dismissal of a formal complaint or any allegation in the complaint, if\nthe party believes that a procedural irregularity affected the outcome, new evidence is available that could affect the\noutcome, or a conflict of interest or bias by the Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), or decision-maker(s) affected the\noutcome. If an appeal is filed, the district shall: (34 CFR 106.45)\n1. Notify the other party in writing when an appeal is filed and implement appeal procedures equally for both\nparties\n2. Ensure that the decision-maker(s) for the appeal is trained in accordance with 34\nCFR 106.45 and is not the same decision-maker(s) who reached the determination regarding responsibility or\ndismissal, the investigator(s), or the Title IX Coordinator\n3. Give both parties a reasonable, equal opportunity to submit a written statement in support of, or challenging,\nthe outcome\n4. Issue a written decision describing the result of the appeal and the rationale for the result\n5. Provide the written decision simultaneously to both parties\nAn appeal must be filed in writing within 10 calendar days of receiving the notice of the decision or dismissal, stating\nthe grounds for the appeal and including any relevant documentation in support of the appeal. Appeals submitted\nafter this deadline are not timely and shall not be considered.\nA written decision shall be provided to the parties within 20 calendar days from the receipt of the appeal.\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nEither party has the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights within\n180 days of the date of the most recently alleged misconduct.\nThe complainant shall be advised of any civil law remedies, including, but not limited to, injunctions, restraining\norders, or other remedies or orders that may be available under state or federal antidiscrimination laws, if applicable.\nRemedies\nWhen a determination of responsibility for sexual harassment has been made against the respondent, the district\nshall provide remedies to the complainant. Such remedies may include the same individualized services described\nabove in the section \"Supportive Measures,\" but need not be nondisciplinary or nonpunitive and need not avoid\nburdening the respondent. (34 CFR 106.45)\nDisciplinary Actions\nThe district shall not impose any disciplinary sanctions or other actions against a respondent, other than supportive\nmeasures as described above in the section \"Supportive Measures,\" until the complaint procedure has been\ncompleted and a determination of responsibility has been made.

To the\nextent allowed by law, CFRA and FMLA leaves shall run concurrently. In circumstances where the leaves do not run\nconcurrently under the law, the employee may take up to 12 work weeks for both CFRA and FMLA, for a total of 24 work\nweeks. (Government Code 12945.2; 29 USC 2612).\nThis 12-month period shall be measured forward from the date the employee's first family care and medical leave begins.

(Government Code 12945, 12945.2; 2 CCR 11046, 11093)\nLeave taken for the birth or placement of a child must be concluded within the 12-month period beginning on the date of the\nbirth or placement of the child. Such leave does not need to be taken in one continuous period of time. (2 CCR 11090; 29\nUSC 2612)\nEach eligible employee shall be granted up to 12 work weeks for family care and medical leave related to the birth or\nplacement of a child, regardless of whether both parents of the child work for the district.\n\nUse/Substitution of Paid Leave\nDuring any otherwise unpaid period of PDL or any FMLA or CFRA leave, the employee may elect to use accrued vacation\nleave, or any other paid time off negotiated with the district that the employee is eligible to use. If the leave is for the\nemployee's own serious health condition or PDL, the employee may also elect to use accrued sick leave during the period of\nleave. (Government Code 12945, 12945.2; 2 CCR 11044; 11092; 29 USC 2612)\nThe district and employee may also come to agreement regarding the use of any additional paid or unpaid time off instead of\nusing the employee's CFRA leave. (2 CCR 11092)\nIntermittent Leave/Reduced Work or Leave Schedule\nPDL and family care and medical leave for the serious health condition of an employee or eligible family member may be\ntaken intermittently or on a reduced work or leave schedule\nwhen medically necessary, as determined by the health care provider of the person with the serious health condition.\nHowever, the district shall limit leave increments to the shortest period of time that the district's payroll system uses to\naccount for absences or use of leave provided it is not to be greater than one hour. (Government Code 12945.2; 2 CCR\n11042, 11090; 29 USC 2612)\nThe basic minimum duration of leave for the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child shall be two weeks. However,\nthe district shall grant a request for such leave of less than two weeks on any two occasions. (2 CCR 11090; 29 USC 2612)\nThe district may require an employee to transfer temporarily to an available alternative position under any of the following\ncircumstances: (2 CCR 11041, 11090; 29 USC 2612)\n1. The employee needs intermiAent leave or leave on a reduced work schedule that is foreseeable based on a planned\nmedical treatment for the employee or family member.\n \n2. A medical cer;\ufb01ca;on is provided by the employee's health care provider that, because of pregnancy, the employee\nhas a medical need to take intermittent leave or leave on a reduced work schedule.\n \n3. The district agrees to permit intermiAent leave or leave on a reduced work schedule due to the birth, adop;on, or\nfoster care placement of the employee's child.\nThe alternative position must have equivalent pay and benefits and must better accommodate recurring periods of leave \nthan the employee's regular job, and the employee must be qualified for the position. Transfer to an alternative position\nmay include altering an existing job to better accommodate the employee's need for intermittent leave or a reduced work or\nleave schedule. (2 CCR 11041, 11090; 29 USC 2612)\nRequest for Leave\nThe district shall consider an employee's request for PDL or family care and medical leave only if the employee provides at\nleast verbal notice sufficient to make the district aware of the need to take the leave and the anticipated timing and duration\nof the leave. (2 CCR 11050, 11091)\nFor family care and medical leave, the employee need not expressly assert or mention FMLA/CFRA to satisfy this\nrequirement. However, the employee must state the reason the leave is needed (e.g., birth of child, medical treatment). If\nmore information is necessary to determine whether the employee is eligible for family care and medical leave, the\nSuperintendent or designee shall inquire further and obtain the necessary details of the leave to be taken. (2 CCR 11091)\nThe district shall respond to requests for leave as soon as practicable, but no later than five business days after receiving the\nemployee's request. (2 CCR 11091)\nBased on the information provided by the employee, the Superintendent or designee shall designate the leave, paid or unpaid,\nas FMLA/CFRA qualifying leave and shall give notice of such designation to the employee. Failure of an employee to respond\nto permissible inquiries regarding the leave request may result in denial of CFRA protection if the district is unable to\ndetermine whether the leave is CFRA qualifying. (2 CCR 11091; 29 CFR 825.300)\nWhen an employee is able to foresee the need for PDL or family care and medical leave at least 30 days in advance of the\nleave, the employee shall provide the district with at least 30 days advance notice before the leave. When the 30 days' notice\nis not practicable because of a lack of knowledge of when leave will be required to begin, a change in circumstances, a\nmedical emergency, or other good cause, the employee shall provide the district with notice as soon as practicable. Failure of\nan employee to provide required notice may result in a denial of leave. (2 CCR 11050, 11091)\n\nIn all instances, the employee shall consult with the Superintendent or designee and make a reasonable effort to schedule,\nsubject to the health care provider's approval, any planned appointment or medical treatment or supervision so as to minimize\ndisruption to district operations.

Upon receiving the district's request, the employee shall provide the\ncertification within 15 calendar days, unless either the Superintendent or designee provides additional time or it is not\npracticable under the particular circumstances, despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts.

The Superintendent or designee may also retroactively designate leave as\nFMLA/CFRA leave as long as appropriate notice is given to the employee and there is no harm or injury to the employee. (2\nCCR 11091; 29 CFR 825.301)\nIf the Superintendent or designee has a good faith objective reason to doubt the validity of a certification that accompanies a\nrequest for leave for the employee's own serious health condition, the Superintendent or designee may require the employee\nto obtain a second opinion from a district-approved health care provider, at district expense. If the second opinion is contrary\nto the first, the Superintendent or designee may require the employee to obtain a third medical opinion from a third health\ncare provider approved by both the employee and the district, again at district expense. The opinion of the third health care\nprovider shall be final and binding. (Government Code 12945.2; 2 CCR 11091; 29 USC 2613)\nCertification for PDL\nThe Superintendent or designee shall request that an employee who is requesting PDL provide certification by a health care\nprovider of the need for leave at the time the employee gives notice of the need for PDL, or within two business days of\ngiving the notice. If the need for PDL is unforeseen, the Superintendent or designee shall request the medical certification\nwithin two business days after the leave commences. The Superintendent or designee may request certification at some later\ndate if the Superintendent or designee has reason to question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration. (2 CCR 11050)\nFor PDL that is foreseeable and for which at least 30 days' notice has been given, the employee shall provide the medical\n\ncertification before the leave begins. When this is not practicable, the employee shall provide the certification within the time\nframe specified by the Superintendent or designee which must be at least 15 calendar days after the request, unless it is not\npracticable under the particular circumstances despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts. (2 CCR 11050)\nMedical certification for PDL purposes shall include a statement that the employee needs to take the leave because the\nemployee is disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition, the date on which the employee became\ndisabled because of pregnancy, and the estimated duration of the leave. (2 CCR 11050)\nIf additional PDL or family care and medical leave is needed when the time estimated by the health care provider expires, the\ndistrict may require the employee to provide recertification in the manner specified for the leave. (Government Code\n12945.2; 2 CCR 11050; 29 USC 2613)\nRelease to Return to Work\nUpon expiration of an employee's PDL or family care and medical leave taken for the employee's own serious health\ncondition, the employee shall present certification from the health care provider of the employee's ability to resume work.\nThe certification shall address the employee's ability to perform the essential job functions of the position.\nRights to Reinstatement\nUpon granting an employee's request for PDL or FMLA/CFRA leave, the Superintendent or designee shall guarantee to\nreinstate the employee in the same or a comparable position when the leave ends. (Government Code 12945.2; 2 CCR\n11043, 11089; 29 USC 2614)\nThe district may refuse to reinstate an employee to the same or a comparable position if the FMLA/CFRA leave was\nfraudulently obtained by the employee. (2 CCR 11089; 29 CFR 825.216)\nThe district may refuse to reinstate an employee to the same position after taking PDL if, at the time the reinstatement is\nrequested, the employee would not otherwise have been employed in that position for legitimate business reasons unrelated\nto the employee's PDL. (2 CCR 11043)\nMaintenance of Benefits/Failure to Return from Leave\nDuring the period when an employee is on PDL or family care and medical leave, the employee shall maintain employee\nstatus with the district and the leave shall not constitute a break in service for purposes of longevity, seniority under any\ncollective bargaining agreement, or any employee benefit plan. (Government Code 12945.2; 2 CCR 11092; 29\nUSC 2614)\nFor up to a maximum of four months for PDL and 12 work weeks for other family care and medical leave, the district shall\ncontinue to provide an eligible employee the group health plan coverage that was in place before the employee took the\nleave. The employee shall reimburse the district for premiums paid during the leave if the employee fails to return to district\nemployment after the expiration of all available leaves and the failure is for a reason other than the continuation, recurrence,\nor onset of a serious health condition or other circumstances beyond the employee's control.

The\nBoard prohibits sexual harassment against district employees and retaliatory behavior or action against any person who\ncomplains, testifies, or otherwise participates in the complaint process established for the purpose of this policy.\nSexual harassment includes, but is not limited to, harassment that is based on the sex, gender, gender identity, gender\nexpression, or sexual orientation of the victim and harassment based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.\nThis policy shall apply to all district employees, interns, volunteers, contractors, job applicants, and other persons with an\nemployment relationship with the district.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall take all actions necessary to ensure the prevention, investigation, and correction of\nsexual harassment, including but not limited to:\n1. Providing training to employees in accordance with law and administrative regulation\n2. Publicizing and disseminating the district's sexual harassment policy to employees and others to whom the policy\nmay apply\n3. Ensuring prompt, thorough, and fair investigation of complaints\n \n4. Taking timely and appropriate corrective/remedial action(s), which may require interim separation of the\ncomplainant and the alleged harasser and subsequent monitoring of developments\nThe Superintendent or designee shall periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the district's strategies to prevent and address\nharassment. Such evaluation may involve conducting regular anonymous employee surveys to assess whether harassment is\noccurring or is perceived to be tolerated, partnering with researchers or other agencies with the needed expertise to evaluate\nthe district's prevention strategies, and using any other effective tool for receiving feedback on systems and/or processes. As\nnecessary, changes shall be made to the harassment policy, complaint procedures, or training.\nAll complaints and allegations of sexual harassment shall be kept confidential to the extent necessary to carry out the\ninvestigation or to take other subsequent necessary actions. (2 CCR 11023)\nSexual Harassment Reports and Complaints\nAny district employee who feels they have been sexually harassed in the performance of their district responsibilities or who\nhas knowledge of any incident of sexual harassment by or against another employee shall immediately report the incident to\ntheir direct supervisor, a district administrator, or the district's Title IX Coordinator. Employees may bypass their supervisor in\nfiling a complaint if the supervisor is the subject of the complaint. A supervisor or administrator who receives a harassment\ncomplaint shall promptly notify the Title IX Coordinator. A supervisor or administrator who receives a harassment complaint\nshall promptly notify the Title IX coordinator.\nOnce notified, the Title IX Coordinator shall ensure the complaint or allegation is addressed through AR\n4119.12/4219.12/4319.12 - Title IX Sexual Harassment Complaint Procedures or AR 4030 - Nondiscrimination in\nEmployment as applicable. Complaints of sexual harassment shall be filed in accordance with the complaint procedure\nspecified in AR 4030 - Nondiscrimination in Employment. An employee may bypass their supervisor in filing a complaint\nwhere the supervisor is the subject of the complaint. Because a complaint or allegation that is dismissed or denied under the\nTitle IX complaint procedure may still be subject to consideration under state law, the Title IX Coordinator shall ensure that\nany implementation of AR 4119.12/4219.12/4319.12 concurrently meets the requirements of AR 4030.\nThe Title IX Coordinator shall offer supportive measures to the complainant and respondent, as deemed appropriate under\nthe circumstances. \nUpon investigation of a sexual harassment complaint, any district employee found to have engaged or participated in sexual\nharassment or to have aided, abetted, incited, compelled, or coerced another to commit sexual harassment in violation of this\npolicy shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, in accordance with law and the applicable collective\nbargaining agreement.\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:",

A district employee conditioning the provision of a district aid, benefit, or service on a person's participation in\nunwelcome sexual conduct\n \n2. Unwelcome conduct determined by a reasonable person to be so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive\nthat it effectively denies a person equal access to the district's education program or activity\n \n3. Sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking as defined in 20 USC 1092 or 34 USC 12291\nAll other sexual harassment complaints or allegations shall be investigated and resolved in accordance with AR 4030\n- Nondiscrimination in Employment. The determination of whether the allegations meet the definition\nof sexual harassment under Title IX shall be made by the district's Title IX Coordinator.\nBecause the complainant has a right to pursue a complaint under AR 4030 for any allegation that is dismissed or\ndenied under the Title IX complaint procedure, the Title IX Coordinator shall ensure that all requirements and\ntimelines for AR 4030 are concurrently met while implementing the Title IX procedure.\nReporting Allegations/Filing a Formal Complaint\nAn employee who is the alleged victim of sexual harassment may submit a report of sexual harassment to the\ndistrict's Title IX Coordinator using the contact information listed in AR 4119.11/4219.11/4319.11\n- Sexual Harassment or to the employee's direct supervisor or other district administrator, who shall forward the\nreport to the Title IX Coordinator within one day of receiving the report.\nUpon receiving such a report, the Title IX Coordinator shall inform the complainant of the right to file a formal\ncomplaint and the process for filing a formal complaint.\nA formal complaint, with the complainant's physical or digital signature, may be filed with the Title IX Coordinator in\nperson, by mail, by email, or by any other method authorized by the district. (34 CFR 106.30)\nEven if the alleged victim chooses not to file a formal complaint, the Title IX Coordinator shall file a formal complaint\nin situations when a safety threat exists. In addition, the Title IX Coordinator may file a formal complaint in other\nsituations as permitted under the Title IX regulations, including as part of the district's obligation to not be\ndeliberately indifferent to known allegations of sexual harassment. In such cases, the Title IX Coordinator shall\nprovide the alleged victim notices as required by the Title IX regulations at specific points in the complaint process.\nThe Title IX Coordinator, investigator, decision-maker, or a facilitator of an informal resolution process shall not have\na conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or an individual complainant or\nrespondent. Such persons shall receive training in accordance with 34 CFR 106.45.

Supportive measures shall be offered as appropriate, as reasonably\navailable, and without charge to the complainant or the respondent before or after the filing of a formal complaint or\nwhere no formal complaint has been filed. Such measures shall be nondisciplinary, nonpunitive, and not unreasonably\nburden the other party, including measures designed to protect the safety of all parties or the district's educational\nenvironment or to deter sexual harassment. Supportive measures may include, but are not limited to, counseling,\nextensions of deadlines, modifications of work schedules, mutual restrictions on contact, changes in work locations,\nleaves of absence, increased security, and monitoring of certain areas of the campus.

(34 CFR 106.44)\nIf the respondent is a student, the district may, on an emergency basis, remove the student from the district's\neducation program or activity, provided that the district conducts an individualized safety and risk analysis,\ndetermines that removal is justified due to an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or\nother individual arising from the allegations, and provides the student with notice and an opportunity to challenge\nthe decision immediately following the removal. This authority to remove a student does not modify a student's\nrights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. (34 CFR\n106.44)\nDismissal of Complaint\nThe Title IX Coordinator shall dismiss a formal complaint if the alleged conduct would not constitute sexual\nharassment as defined in 34 CFR 106.30 even if proved. The Title IX Coordinator shall also dismiss any complaint in\nwhich the alleged conduct did not occur in the district's education program or activity or did not occur against a\nperson in the United States, and may dismiss a formal complaint if the complainant notifies the district in writing that\nthe complainant would like to withdraw the complaint or any allegations in the complaint, the respondent is no\nlonger employed by the district, or sufficient circumstances prevent the district from gathering evidence sufficient to\nreach a determination with regard to the complaint. (34 CFR 106.45)\nUpon dismissal, the Title IX Coordinator shall promptly send written notice of the dismissal and the reasons for the\ndismissal simultaneously to the parties, and shall inform them of their right to appeal the dismissal of a formal\ncomplaint or any allegation in the complaint in accordance with the appeal procedures described in the section\n\"Appeals\" below. (34 CFR 106.45)\nIf a complaint is dismissed, the conduct may still be addressed pursuant to AR 4030 - Nondiscrimination in\nEmployment as applicable.\nInformal Resolution Process\nWhen a formal complaint of sexual harassment is filed, the district may offer an informal resolution process, such as\nmediation, at any time prior to reaching a determination regarding responsibility. The district shall not require a party\nto participate in the informal resolution process or to waive the right to an investigation and adjudication of a formal\ncomplaint. (34 CFR 106.45)\nThe district may facilitate an informal resolution process provided that the district: (34 CFR 106.45)\n1. Provides the parties with written notice disclosing the allegations, the requirements of the informal resolution\nprocess, the right to withdraw from the informal process and resume the formal complaint process, and any\nconsequences resulting from participating in the informal resolution process, including that records will be\nmaintained or could be shared.\n \n2.

(Government Code 12945, 12945.2; 2 CCR 11044; 11092; 29 USC 2612)\nThe district and employee may also come to agreement regarding the use of any additional paid or unpaid time off\ninstead of using the employee's CFRA leave.

Transfer to an\nalternative position may include altering an existing job to better accommodate the employee's need for intermittent\nleave or a reduced work or leave schedule. (2 CCR 11041, 11090; 29 USC 2612)\nRequest for Leave\nThe district shall consider an employee's request for PDL or family care and medical leave only if the employee\nprovides at least verbal notice sufficient to make the district aware of the need to take the leave and the anticipated\ntiming and duration of the leave.

Failure of an employee to provide required notice may result in a denial of leave. (2 CCR 11050,\n11091)\nIn all instances, the employee shall consult with the Superintendent or designee and make a reasonable effort to\nschedule, subject to the health care provider's approval, any planned appointment or medical treatment or\nsupervision so as to minimize disruption to district operations.

(2 CCR 11091; 29 CFR 825.301)\nIf the Superintendent or designee has a good faith objective reason to doubt the validity of a certification that\naccompanies a request for leave for the employee's own serious health condition, the Superintendent or designee\nmay require the employee to obtain a second opinion from a district-approved health care provider, at district\nexpense. If the second opinion is contrary to the first, the Superintendent or designee may require the employee to\nobtain a third medical opinion from a third health care provider approved by both the employee and the district,\nagain at district expense.

When this is not practicable, the employee shall provide the\ncertification within the time frame specified by the Superintendent or designee which must be at least 15 calendar\ndays after the request, unless it is not practicable under the particular circumstances despite the employee's diligent,\ngood faith efforts. (2 CCR 11050)\nMedical certification for PDL purposes shall include a statement that the employee needs to take the leave because\nthe employee is disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition, the date on which the employee\nbecame disabled because of pregnancy, and the estimated duration of the leave.

The employee shall reimburse the district for premiums paid during the leave if the employee fails to\nreturn to district employment after the expiration of all available leaves and the failure is for a reason other than the\ncontinuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition or other circumstances beyond the employee's\ncontrol.

      "content": "The Governing Board believes that absenteeism, whatever the cause, may be an early warning sign of poor academic\nachievement and may put students at risk of dropping out of school. The Board desires to ensure that all students\nattend school in accordance with the state's compulsory education law and take full advantage of educational\nopportunities provided by the district, and that students who are identified as chronically absent or truant receive\nappropriate support services and interventions as early as possible.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall establish a system to accurately track student attendance in order to identify\nindividual students who are chronic absentees and truants, as defined in law and administrative regulation, and to\nidentify patterns of absence throughout the district.\nThe Superintendent, attendance supervisor, or designee shall consult with students, parents/guardians, school staff,\nand community agencies, as appropriate, to identify factors contributing to chronic absence and truancy, including in\nrelation to grade level and student subgroup patterns of chronic absence and truancy.\nThe Superintendent, attendance supervisor, or designee shall develop a tiered approach to reducing chronic absence.\nSuch an approach shall include strategies for preventing attendance problems, which may include, but are not limited\nto, efforts to provide a safe and positive school environment; relevant and engaging learning experiences; school\nactivities that help develop students' feelings of connectedness with the school, including personalized relationships\nbetween students and teachers and/or support staff; school-based health services; letters alerting parents/guardians\nto the value of regular school attendance, including the use of bilingual aides and communication in the primary\nlanguage used by parents/guardians; and incentives and rewards to recognize students who achieve excellent\nattendance or demonstrate significant improvement in attendance.\nThe tiered approach shall also provide for early outreach to students as soon as they show signs of poor attendance\nor if they were chronically absent in the prior school year. Early intervention may include personalized outreach,\nindividual attendance plans, and/or mentoring to students with moderate levels of chronic absence, with additional\nintensive, interagency wrap-around services for students with the highest level of absence.\nStudents with serious attendance problems shall be provided with interventions specific to their needs, which may\ninclude, but are not limited to, health care referrals; transportation assistance; counseling, including trauma-informed\npractices, for mental or emotional difficulties; academic supports; efforts to address school or community safety\nconcerns; discussions with the student and parent/guardian about their attitudes regarding schooling; or other\nstrategies to remove identified barriers to school attendance. The Superintendent, attendance supervisor, or\ndesignee may collaborate with child welfare services, law enforcement, courts, public health care agencies, other\ngovernment agencies, and/or medical, mental health, and oral health care providers to make alternative educational\nprograms and support services available for students and families.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall ensure that staff assigned to fulfill attendance-related duties are trained in\nimplementing a trauma-informed approach to chronic absence and receive information about the high correlation\nbetween chronic absence and exposure to adverse childhood experiences.\nStudents who are identified as chronically absent or truant shall be subject to the interventions specified in law and\nadministrative regulation.\nTo provide students with an opportunity to make up lost instructional time and offset absences, the Superintendent\nor designee may implement an attendance recovery program for students in grades transitional kindergarten-12. Any\nsuch attendance recovery program shall be operated in accordance with Education Code 46211 and as specified in\nthe accompanying administrative regulation.\nA student's truancy, tardiness, or other absence from school shall not be the basis for suspension or expulsion.\nAlternative strategies and positive reinforcement for attendance shall be used whenever possible.\nThe Superintendent, attendance supervisor, or designee shall at least annually report to the Board regarding student\nattendance patterns in the district, including rates of chronic absence and truancy districtwide and for each school,\ngrade level, and numerically significant student subgroup as defined in Education Code 52052. Such information shall\nbe used to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies implemented to reduce chronic absence and truancy and to\ndevelop annual goals and specific actions for student attendance and engagement to be included in the district's local\ncontrol and accountability plan and other applicable school and district plans. As appropriate, the Superintendent or\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\ndesignee shall engage school staff in program evaluation and improvement and in the determination of how to best\nallocate available community resources.",

      "content": "District School of Choice Program\n\nSix of the district's innovative programs and its schools are considered non-boundary schools or Schools of Choice.\nThis means that these schools do not use an address to determine priority. All students may apply for admission and\nthey are then selected randomly by lottery.\nParents must first register their child before applying for a School of Choice transfer. Please fill out the Registration\nForm first. Parents will then have the option to fill out a School of Choice transfer request.\nIn addition, families may also transfer to other neighborhood schools. Priority is given to students who live within the\nschool's neighborhood and, if there are spaces available after the neighborhood children are placed, students who\nhave requested a transfer from another neighborhood are then placed via a random lottery.\nShould there be more interest than spaces available, waitlists are created after the lottery placements and students\nare placed at their requested school when a spot becomes available. If a student moves into the area after the open\nenrollment period and their neighborhood school is full, they will be placed at a school that has openings. Students\nwill be placed at the top of their neighborhood school's waitlist and will be placed before any other non-\nneighborhood students on the waitlist.\nTransfers for Victims of a Violent Criminal Offense\nWithin a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed 14 days, after it has been determined that a student has been the\nvictim of a violent criminal offense while on school grounds, the student's parents/guardians shall be offered an\noption to transfer their child to an eligible school identified by the Superintendent or designee. In making the\ndetermination that a student has been a victim of a violent criminal offense, the Superintendent or designee shall\nconsider the specific circumstances of the incident and consult with local law enforcement as appropriate. Examples\nof violent criminal offenses include, but are not limited to, attempted murder, battery with serious bodily injury,\nassault with a deadly weapon, rape, sexual battery, robbery, extortion, or hate crimes.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall consider the needs and preferences of the affected student and their\nparent/guardian in making the offer. If the parent/guardian elects to transfer their child, the transfer shall be\ncompleted as soon as practicable.\nTransfers from a \"Persistently Dangerous\" School\nUpon receipt of notification from the California Department of Education (CDE) that a district school has been\ndesignated as \"persistently dangerous,\" intradistrict transfers shall be granted as follows:\n1. Within 10 days of receipt of the notification from CDE, the Superintendent or designee shall provide\nparents/guardians of students attending the school with notice of the school's designation. Along with this\nnotification, or at least 14 calendar days before the start of the school year, the Superintendent or designee\nshall provide a list of other district schools to which any student of the school that is designated as persistently\ndangerous may transfer.\n \n2. Parents/guardians who desire to transfer their child out of the school shall provide a written response to the\nSuperintendent or designee and shall rank-order their preferences from among all schools identified by the\nSuperintendent or designee as eligible to receive transfer students.\n \n3. The Superintendent or designee shall consider the needs and preferences of students and parents/guardians\nbefore making an assignment, but is not obligated to accept the parent/guardian's preference if the assignment\nis not feasible due to space constraints or other considerations. The Superintendent or designee shall notify\nthe parents/guardians of the assigned school.\n \n4. For students whose parents/guardians accept the offer, the transfer shall be made as quickly as possible. If the\nparents/guardians decline the assigned school, the student may remain in the current school.\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nThe transfer shall remain in effect as long as the student's school of origin is identified as \"persistently dangerous.\"\nThe Superintendent or designee may choose to make the transfer permanent based on the educational needs of the\nstudent, parent/guardian preferences, and other factors affecting the student's ability to succeed if returned to the\nschool of origin.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall cooperate with neighboring districts to develop an interdistrict transfer\nprogram in the event that space is not available in a district school.\nOther Intradistrict Open Enrollment\nExcept for transfers for victims of a violent crime and from a \"persistently dangerous school,\" the following\nprocedures shall apply to intradistrict open enrollment:\n1. The Superintendent or designee shall identify those schools which may have space available for additional\nstudents. A list of those schools and open enrollment applications shall be available at each school site, the\ndistrict office, and on the district's web site.\n \n2. After the enrollment priorities have been applied in accordance with Board policy, if there are more requests\nfor a particular school than there are spaces available, a random drawing shall be held from the applicant pool.\nA waiting list shall be established to indicate the order in which applicants may be accepted if openings occur\nduring the year. Late applicants shall not be added to the waiting list for the current year but shall instead wait\nfor a subsequent lottery.\n \n3. The Superintendent or designee shall provide written notification to applicants as to whether their applications\nhave been approved, denied, or placed on a waiting list. If the application is denied, the reasons for denial shall\nbe stated.\n \n4. Approved applicants must confirm their enrollment within 10 school days.\nAny student who is granted a transfer out of a school that had been identified by CDE for comprehensive support\nand improvement shall be allowed to remain in the school of enrollment until completing the highest grade offered at\nthat school. (20 USC 6311)\nA student granted intradistrict enrollment under other circumstances shall not be required to reapply for readmission\nbut may be subject to displacement due to excessive enrollment.\nAny complaints regarding the open enrollment process shall be submitted in accordance with the applicable\ncomplaint procedure.\nNotifications\nNotifications shall be sent to parents/guardians at the beginning of each school year, with school of choice\ninformation describing all current statutory attendance options and local attendance available in the district. Such\nnotification shall include: (Education Code 35160.5, 48980)\n1. All options for meeting residency requirements for school attendance.\n \n2. Program options offered within local attendance areas.\n \n3. A description of any special program options available on both an interdistrict and intradistrict basis.\n \n4. A description of the procedure for application for alternative attendance areas or programs and the appeals\nprocess available, if any, when a change of attendance is denied.\n \n5. A district application form for requesting a change of attendance.\n \n6. The explanation of attendance options under California law as provided by the CDE.",

      "content": "The Governing Board recognizes that parents/guardians of students who reside within the geographic boundaries of one\ndistrict may, for a variety of reasons, desire to enroll their children in a school in another district.\nFollowing the principle that the financial and educational responsibility for a student's education rests primarily with the\nschool district of legal residence, it is the policy of the Governing Board that students should attend school in the district of\nlegal residence.\nThe Board discourages transfers into the District and will consider approving such transfers only on a case-by-case basis\nthrough an inter-district attendance agreement or as otherwise required by law. The Board may enter into an agreement with\nany other school district, for a term not to exceed five school years, for the inter-district attendance of students who are\nresidents of the districts. The agreement shall specify the terms and conditions under which inter-district attendance shall be\npermitted or denied. It also may contain standards agreed upon by both districts for reapplication and/or revocation of the\nstudent's permit. (Education Code 46600) Upon receiving a permit for transfer into the district that has been approved by the\nstudent's district of residence, or upon receiving a written request from the parent/guardian of a district student who wishes\nto enroll in another district, the Superintendent or designee shall review the request and may approve or deny the permit\nsubject to the terms and conditions of the inter-district attendance agreement.\nStudents residing outside the District who are discovered to be attending district schools without an authorized inter-district\nattendance agreement will be disenrolled barring extenuating circumstances. Inter-district agreements for special education\nstudents are subject to procedures outlined in the San Mateo County Special Education Local Plan (SELPA), Regulation\nSection IV, F-1 and F-2 (Exhibit Y).\nTransportation: Upon parent/guardian request, the district may provide transportation assistance to a student receiving an\ninter- district transfer who is eligible for free and reduced-price meals and if the child of an active duty military\nparent/guardian or a victim of bullying, as defined in Education Code 46600. (Education Code 46600) In addition, upon\nrequest of a student's parent/guardian, the Superintendent or designee may authorize transportation for any inter-district\ntransfer student to and from designated bus stops within the attendance area of the school that the student attends if space\nis available.\nIf an interdistrict transfer student is approved and enrolls in a District school, that student must remain at that school.

School rules shall ensure\nthat prior to denial of the privilege(s), the student, and where practicable his/her parent/guardian, is made aware of\nthe grounds for such denial and that the student is given an opportunity to respond to the proposed denial. If\nprivilege(s) are to be denied, the student and parent/guardian shall receive written notice of the denied privilege and\nthe means whereby he/she may appeal this decision.\nHonors and Awards\nThe Superintendent or designee shall identify school-sponsored awards which may be given during graduation\nexercises. A separate awards program may be held to recognize graduating students receiving other school and\nnonschool awards.\nElementary/Middle School Promotion Exercises\nThe Board desires that each elementary and middle school provide age-appropriate promotion exercises to\nrecognize students who have completed the school's course of study.",

(Education Code 49005.1)\nProhibitions\nSeclusion and behavioral restraint of students shall not be used in any form as a means of coercion, discipline, convenience, \nor retaliation. (Education Code 49005.8)\nIn addition, staff shall not take any of the following actions: (Education Code 49005.2, 49005.8)\n1. \n \nAdminister a drug that is not a standard treatment for a student's medical or psychiatric condition in order to control \nthe student's behavior or restrict the student's freedom of movement\n \n \n2. \n \nUse locked seclusion, unless it is in a facility otherwise licensed or permitted by state law to use as a locked room\n \n \n3. \n \nUse a physical restraint technique that obstructs a student's respiratory airway or impairs a student's breathing or \nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nrespiratory capacity, including a technique in which a staff member places pressure on the student's back or places the \nstaff member's body weight against the student's torso or back\n \n \n4. \n \nUse a behavioral restraint technique that restricts breathing, including, but not limited to, the use of a pillow, blanket, \ncarpet, mat, or other item to cover a student's face\n \n \n5. \n \nPlace a student in a facedown position with the student's hands held or restrained behind the student's back\n \n \n6. \n \nUse a behavioral restraint for longer than is necessary to contain the behavior that poses a clear and present danger of \nserious physical harm to the student or others\n \nLimited Use of Seclusion or Restraint\nStaff shall avoid the use of seclusion and behavioral restraint of students whenever possible. Seclusion or behavioral restraint \nmay be used only to control student behavior that poses a clear and present danger of serious physical harm to the student or \nothers, which cannot be immediately prevented by a response that is less restrictive. (Education Code 49005.4, 49005.6, \n49005.8)\nWhen used, seclusion or restraint shall not be applied for longer than is necessary to contain the dangerous behavior. For any \nsituation that requires a prolonged use of an emergency intervention, staff shall seek the assistance of the principal or law \nenforcement agency, as applicable to the situation. (Education Code 56521.1)\nIf a student is put in seclusion, the student shall be under constant, direct observation of a staff member. Such observation \nmay be through a window or another barrier through which the staff member is able to make direct eye contact with the \nstudent, but shall not be made through indirect means such as a security camera or closed-circuit television. (Education Code \n49005.8)\nIf a student is restrained, staff shall afford the student the least restrictive alternative and the maximum freedom of \nmovement, and shall use the least number of restraint points, while ensuring the physical safety of the student and others. \n(Education Code 49005.8)\nIf a prone restraint technique is used on a student, a staff member shall observe the student for any signs of physical distress \nthroughout the use of the restraint.

(Education Code 212.1)\nThe principal or designee is authorized to enforce this policy and shall inform any student who does not reasonably\nconform to the dress code. The dress code shall not be enforced in a manner that discriminates against a particular\nviewpoint or results in a disproportionate application of the dress code based on students' gender, sexual orientation,\nrace, ethnicity, household income, or body type or size.\nSchool administrators, teachers, and other staff shall be notified of appropriate and equitable enforcement of the\ndress code.\nWhen practical, students shall not be directed to correct a dress code violation during instructional time or in front of\nother students.\nStudents and parents/guardians shall be informed about dress and grooming standards at the beginning of the school\nyear and whenever these standards are revised. Repeated violations or refusal to comply with the district's dress\ncode may result in disciplinary action.\nThe principal, staff and parents/guardians at a school may establish a reasonable dress code that prohibits students\nfrom wearing gang-related apparel when there is evidence of a gang presence that disrupts or threatens to disrupt\nthe school's activities. Such a proposed dress code may be included as part of the school safety plan and must be\npresented to the Board for approval. The Board shall approve the plan upon determining that it is necessary to\nprotect the health and safety of the school environment.\nWhen determining specific items of clothing that may be defined as gang apparel, the school shall ensure that the\ndetermination is free from bias based on race, ethnicity, national origin, immigration status, or other protected\ncharacteristics.\nUniforms\nThe Board may approve a school-initiated dress code requiring students at the school to wear a school uniform\nwhenever the Board determines that such a dress code will promote student achievement, a positive school climate,\nand/or student safety.\nIf a school's plan to require uniforms is adopted, the Superintendent or designee shall establish procedures whereby\nparents/guardians may choose to have their children exempted from the school uniform policy. Students shall not be\npenalized academically, otherwise discriminated against or denied attendance to school if their parents/guardians so\ndecide.

Clothing, jewelry and personal items (backpacks, fanny packs, gym bags, water bottles etc.) shall be free of\nwriting, pictures or any other insignia which are crude, lewd, obscene, profane or sexually suggestive, or which\npromote the use of drugs, alcohol, tobacco, or which advocate racial, ethnic or religious prejudice, or any other\nillegal activity.\n2. Appropriate shoes must be worn at all times.\n3. Hats, caps and other head coverings shall not be worn indoors.\n4. Clothes shall be sufficient to conceal undergarments at all times. See-through or fish- net fabrics, halter tops,\noff-the-shoulder or low-cut tops, bare midriffs and skirts or shorts shorter than mid-thigh are prohibited.\nThe dress code shall be modified as appropriate to accommodate a student's religious or cultural observance, health\ncondition, or other circumstance deemed necessary by the principal or designee. In addition, the principal or\ndesignee may impose dress requirements to accommodate the needs of special school activities, physical education\nclasses, athletic activities, and other extracurricular and cocurricular activities.\nNo grade of a student participating in a physical education class shall be adversely affected if the student does not\nwear standardized physical education apparel because of circumstances beyond the student's control. (Education\nCode 49066)\nEach school shall allow students to wear sun-protective clothing, including but not limited to hats, for outdoor use\nduring the school day. (Education Code 35183.5)\nAt individual schools that have a dress code prohibiting gang-related apparel at school or school activities, the\nprincipal, staff and parents/guardians participating in the development of the school safety plan shall define \"gang-\nrelated apparel\" and shall limit this definition to apparel that reasonably could be determined to threaten the health\nand safety of the school environment if it were worn or displayed on a school campus. (Education Code 32282)\nBecause gang-related symbols are constantly changing, definitions of gang-related apparel shall be reviewed at least\nonce each semester and updated whenever related information is received. As necessary, the school shall collaborate\nwith law enforcement agencies to update definitions of gang-related apparel.\nUniforms\nIn schools where a schoolwide uniform is required, the principal, staff and parents/guardians of the individual school\nshall jointly select the specific uniform to be worn. (Education Code 35183)\nAt least six months before a school uniform policy is implemented, the principal or designee shall notify\nparents/guardians of this policy. (Education Code 35183)\nParents/guardians shall also be informed of their right to have their child exempted.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall establish criteria for determining student eligibility for financial assistance\nwhen purchasing uniforms.\nStudents who participate in a nationally recognized youth organization shall be allowed to wear organization\nuniforms on days when the organization has a scheduled meeting.

The Board believes that such programs can reduce violence and promote\ncommunication, personal responsibility and problem-solving skills among students.\nConflict resolution strategies shall be considered as part of each school's comprehensive safety plan and\nincorporated into other district discipline procedures as appropriate. Conflict resolution programs shall not supplant\nthe authority of staff to take appropriate action as necessary to prevent violence, ensure student safety, maintain\norder in the school, and institute disciplinary measures.\nSchoolwide programs may include curriculum in conflict resolution, including, but not limited to, instruction in\neffective communication and listening, critical thinking, problem-solving processes and the use of negotiation to find\nmutually acceptable solutions. In addition, the curriculum may address students' ethical and social development,\nrespect for diversity, and interpersonal and behavioral skills.\nConflict resolution programs may incorporate peer mediation strategies in which selected students are specially\ntrained to work with their peers in resolving conflicts.\nStudents' participation in any peer mediation program shall be voluntary and kept confidential by all parties involved.\nIn developing a conflict resolution and/or peer mediation program, school-site teams shall address, as appropriate:\n1. The grade levels and courses in which the conflict resolution curriculum shall be delivered\n \n2. Staff development related to the implementation of the curriculum and modeling of appropriate behaviors and\ncommunication skills\n \n3. The selection of peer mediators involving, to the extent possible, a cross-section of students in terms of grade,\ngender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, and including some students who exhibit negative leadership\namong peers\n \n4. Training and support for peer mediators, including training in mediation processes and in the skills related to\nunderstanding conflict, communicating effectively and listening\n \n5. The process for identifying and referring students to the peer mediation program\n \n6. The types of conflicts suitable for peer mediation\n \n7. Scheduling and location of peer mediation sessions\n \n8. Methods of obtaining and recording agreement from all disputants\n \n9.

Such processes shall be implemented in a manner that preserves campus security, minimizes instructional\ninterruptions, and promotes student safety and privacy.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall make epinephrine auto-injectors available at each school for providing emergency\nmedical aid to any person suffering, or reasonably believed to be suffering, from an anaphylactic reaction.

Because of the conflict between state and federal law\nregarding the legality of medicinal cannabis, the Board cannot allow the administration of medicinal cannabis to students on\nschool grounds by parents/guardians or school personnel. Administration of medicinal cannabis will need to occur off of\nschool grounds.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with city and county emergency responders, including local public health\nadministrators, to design procedures or measures for addressing an emergency such as a public disaster or epidemic.\nAdministration of Medication by School Personnel\nWhen allowed by law, medication prescribed to a student by an authorized health care provider may be administered by a\nschool nurse or, when a school nurse or other medically licensed person is unavailable and the physician has authorized\nadministration of medication by unlicensed personnel for a particular student, by other designated school personnel with\nappropriate training. School nurses and other designated school personnel shall administer medications to students in\naccordance with law, Board policy, administrative regulation, and, as applicable, the written statement provided by the\nstudent's parent/guardian and authorized health care provider. Such personnel shall be afforded appropriate liability\nprotection.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall ensure that school personnel designated to administer any medication receive\nappropriate training and, as necessary, retraining from qualified medical personnel before any medication is administered. At a\nminimum, the training shall cover how and when such medication should be administered, the recognition of symptoms and\ntreatment, emergency follow-up procedures, and the proper documentation and storage of medication. Such trained,\nunlicensed designated school personnel shall be supervised by, and provided with immediate communication access to, a\nschool nurse, physician, or other appropriate individual.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall maintain documentation of the training and ongoing supervision, as well as annual\nwritten verification of competency of other designated school personnel.\nLegal Reference EDUCATION CODE\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\n48980 Notification at beginning of term\n49407 Liability for treatment 49408 Emergency information 49414 Emergency epinephrine auto-injectors\n49414.3 Emergency medical assistance; administration of medication for opioid overdose 49414.5 Providing school personnel with voluntary emergency training\n49422-49427 Employment of medical personnel, especially:\n49423 Administration of prescribed medication for student\n49423.1 Inhaled asthma medication 49480 Continuing medication regimen; notice\nBUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE\n2700-2837 Nursing, especially:\n2726 Authority not conferred 2727 Exceptions in general 3501 Definitions\n4119.2 Acquisition of epinephrine auto-injectors\n4119.8 Acquisition of naloxone hydrochloride or another opioid antagonist\nHEALTH AND SAFETY CODE\n11362.7-11362.85 Medicinal cannabis CODE OF REGULATIONS, TITLE 5\n600-611 Administering medication to students UNITED STATES CODE, TITLE 20\n1232g Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 1400-1482 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act UNITED STATES CODE, TITLE 21\n812 Schedules of controlled substances\n844 Penalties for possession of controlled substance UNITED STATES CODE, TITLE 29\n794 Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504 COURT DECISIONS\nAmerican Nurses Association v.

      "content": "The Board of Education desires to protect students from risks posed by exposure to infectious diseases while\nproviding an appropriate education for all students. The Board recognizes that prevention and education are the\nmost effective means of limiting the spread of infectious diseases. The Superintendent or designee shall collaborate\nwith local and state health officials to develop and regularly update a comprehensive plan for disease prevention that\npromotes preventative measures, mitigation, education, communication, and training of students and staff. All\nmeasures to limit the spread of infectious diseases shall be nondiscriminatory and ensure that equity is promoted.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall regularly review resources available from health experts to ensure that district\nprograms are based on the most up-to-date information.\nThe district's comprehensive health education program shall provide age-appropriate information about the nature\nand symptoms of communicable diseases, their transmission, and how to help prevent the spread of contagious\ndiseases.\nIf the local health officer notifies the district of an outbreak of a communicable disease, or the imminent and\nproximate threat of a communicable disease outbreak or epidemic that threatens the public's health, the district shall\ntake any action that the health officer deems necessary to control the spread of the disease. The district shall comply\nwith all applicable state and federal privacy laws in regard to any such information received from the local health\nofficer. (Health and Safety Code 120175.5)\nStudents and staff shall observe universal precautions in order to prevent exposure to bloodborne pathogens and to\nprevent the spread of infectious diseases.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall inform students of the precautions to be used in cases of exposure to blood or\nother body fluids through injury, accident, or classroom instruction.\nStudents with Infectious Diseases\nThe Superintendent or designee shall exclude students only in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative\nregulation. Because bloodborne pathogens such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency\nvirus (HIV) are not casually transmitted, the presence of infectious conditions of this type is not, by itself, sufficient\nreason to exclude students from attending school.\nParents/guardians are strongly encouraged to inform the Superintendent or designee if their child has an infectious\ndisease so that school staff may work cooperatively with the student's parents/guardians to minimize the child's\nexposure to other students and staff in the school setting. If necessary, the Superintendent or designee shall inform\nthe local health official of any potential outbreak. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that student\nconfidentiality rights are strictly observed in accordance with law.",

      "content": "Definitions\nSpecial dietary needs include food intolerances, allergies, and other medical needs that may require avoidance of\nspecific foods.\nFood allergies are abnormal responses of the body's immune system to certain foods or ingredients.\nAnaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity to a substance and may be caused by a food allergy.\nSymptoms may include shortness of breath, wheezing, difficulty breathing, difficulty talking or swallowing, hives,\nitching, swelling, shock, or asthma. (Education Code 49414)\nIn severe cases, anaphylaxis may result in lowered blood pressure, loss of consciousness, or even death. Symptoms\ntypically appear immediately after exposure to a certain food or substance but in rare cases may occur after a few\nhours.\nEpinephrine auto-injector is a disposable drug delivery system with a spring-activated concealed needle that is\ndesigned for emergency administration of epinephrine to persons suffering a potentially fatal reaction to anaphylaxis.\n(Education Code 49414)\nNotification by Parent/Guardian\nIf their child has a known food allergy, the parents/guardians shall notify the Superintendent or designee, in writing,\nand provide written medical documentation, signed by a physician, that describes the nature of the student's\ncondition, instructions, and necessary medications. If the food allergy requires food substitutions or modifications in\nschool meals, the written statement shall also describe the specific foods to be restricted and the foods that should\nbe substituted.\nPrevention\nTo minimize students' exposure to foods to which they are allergic, the Superintendent or designee shall, at a\nminimum, implement the following preventive measures:\n1. Notification to District Staff\nWhen notified by the parent/guardian that a student has a food allergy, the Superintendent or designee shall\ninform the student's principal, teacher(s), bus driver, school nurse, coach, substitute teacher, and/or any other\npersonnel responsible for supervising the student.\nThe principal or designee shall notify substitute staff of any students with known food allergies and the\nschool's response plan.\n \n2. Food Services\nThe district's food services program shall make food substitutions in breakfasts, lunches, and after-school\nsnacks when students are considered to have a disability under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of\n1973 that restricts their diet and when a physician has signed a statement of need that includes recommended\nalternate foods. (7 CFR 210.10, 220.8)\nSubstitutions may be made on a case-by-case basis for students who do not have a disability under Section\n504 but who cannot consume the regular breakfast, lunch, or after-school snack because of medical or other\nspecial dietary needs, when supported by a statement of need signed by a recognized medical authority. (7\nCFR 210.10, 220.8, 225.16)\nThe district's food services staff shall check food labels or specifications to ensure that foods do not contain\ntraces of substances to which the student is allergic.\nUnder no circumstances shall food services staff prescribe nutritional requirements or revise a diet order\nprescribed by a physician.\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nFood substitutions shall not result in any additional cost to the student.\n \n3. Class Parties/School Activities\nWithout identifying the student, the principal or teacher may notify parents/guardians of other students in the\nclass that a student is allergic to a specific food and may request that the food not be provided at class parties\nor other school events.\nWhenever the ingredients in any food served at class parties or other school activities are unknown, the\nstudent shall be encouraged to avoid the food.\n \n4. Sanitation and Cleaning\nTo avoid spreading allergens, cafeteria tables and classroom surfaces shall be cleaned with a fresh cloth or\ndisposable paper towels and cleaning products known to effectively remove food proteins, excluding waterless\ncleaners or instant hand sanitizers that do not involve a wet-wash step. Cross-contact from a sponge or cloth\nused to clean allergen-containing tabletops shall be avoided.\nStaff shall use and promote hand-washing using soap and water before and after food handling.\nStudents shall be notified that exchanging meals or utensils is prohibited.\n \n5. Professional Development\nSchoolwide professional development shall be provided to appropriate staff on the identification and\nmanagement of food allergies, including avoidance measures, typical symptoms, the proper use of epinephrine\nauto-injectors, documentation and storage of medication, and emergency drills.\n \n6. Supervision of Students\nStaff who are trained and knowledgeable about symptoms of anaphylaxis and actions to take in an emergency\nshall provide supervision in the classroom and cafeteria and on the playground whenever students known to\nhave a food allergy are on school grounds.\n \n7. Health Education\nThe district's health education curriculum may include instruction on food allergies in order to assist food-allergic\nstudents in taking responsibility for monitoring their diet and to teach other students about the dangers of sharing\nfoods or utensils with others.\nEmergency Response\nEpinephrine auto-injectors or other medicine provided for use in the event of an anaphylactic shock reaction shall be\nstored and used in accordance with law and BP/AR 5141.21 - Administering Medication and Monitoring Health\nConditions.\nIn addition, staff shall call 911 and seek immediate medical attention for a student experiencing an anaphylactic\nshock reaction.\nAs soon as possible, school staff shall contact the student's parents/guardians or other person identified as an\nemergency contact.",

(Health and Safety Code 120372, 120372.05)\n \n2. The student's parent/guardian filed with the district, before January 1, 2016, a letter or written affidavit stating\nthat an immunization is contrary to the student's personal beliefs, in which case the student shall be exempted\nfrom the immunization until the student enrolls in the next applicable grade span requiring immunization (birth\nto preschool, grades K-6, grades 7-12).

A student transferring from a school outside the district shall\npresent a copy of the personal beliefs exemption upon enrollment. When a student transfers into the district\nfrom outside California and presents a personal beliefs exemption issued by another state or country prior to\nJanuary 1, 2016, the Superintendent or designee may consult with legal counsel regarding the applicable\nimmunization requirements.\n \n3.

The Superintendent or\ndesignee shall notify the student's parents/guardians of the date by which the student must complete all the\nremaining doses as specified in 17 CCR 6035. (Health and Safety Code 120340; 17 CCR 6035)\nIn addition, a transfer student may be conditionally admitted for up to 30 school days while the student's\nimmunization records are being transferred from the previous school. If such documentation is not presented within\n30 days, the student shall be excluded from school until the required immunizations have been administered.

(Health and Safety Code 120375; 17 CCR 6040, 6070)\nExclusions Due to Lack of Immunizations\nIf an enrolled student who was previously believed to be in compliance with immunization requirements is\nsubsequently discovered to not be in compliance with requirements for unconditional or conditional admission, the\nSuperintendent or designee shall notify the parent/guardian that evidence of proper immunization or an appropriate\nexemption must be provided within 10 school days. This notice shall refer the parent/guardian to the student's usual\nsource of medical care or, if the student has no usual source of medical care, then to the county health department\nor school immunization program, if any.

(Education Code 215) \nMessaging about suicide has an effect on suicidal thinking and behaviors. Consequently, Redwood City School\nDistrict along with its partners has critically reviewed and will continue to review all materials and resources used in\nawareness efforts to ensure they align with best practices for safe messaging about suicide.\nStaff development shall include research and information related to the following topics:\n1. The higher risk of suicide among certain groups, including, but not limited to, students who are bereaved by\nsuicide; students with disabilities, mental illness, or substance use disorders; students who are experiencing\nhomelessness or who are in out-of-home settings such as foster care; and students who are lesbian, gay,\nbisexual, transgender, or questioning youth\n \n2. Individual risk factors such as previous suicide attempt(s) or self-harm, history of depression or mental illness,\nfamily history of suicide or violence, feelings of isolation, interpersonal conflicts, a recent severe stressor or\nloss, family instability, impulsivity, and other factors\n \n3. Warning signs that may indicate depression, emotional distress, or suicidal intentions, such as changes in\nstudents' personality or behavior and verbalizations of hopelessness or suicidal intent\n \n4. Protective factors that may help to decrease a student's suicide risk, such as resiliency, problem-solving ability,\naccess to mental health care, and positive connections to family, peers, school, and community\n \n5. Instructional strategies for teaching the suicide prevention curriculum and promoting mental and emotional\nhealth\n \n6. School and community resources and services, including resources and services that meet the specific needs of\nhigh-risk groups\n \n7.

District procedures for responding after a suicide has occurred\nInstruction\nThe district's comprehensive health education program shall promote the healthy students mental, emotional, and\nsocial development of students and shall be aligned with the state content standards and curriculum framework.\nSuicide prevention instruction shall be incorporated into the health education curriculum at grade 7 and grade 8 and\nshall be designed to help students:\n1. Identify and analyze signs of depression and self-destructive behaviors and understand how feelings of\ndepression, loss, isolation, inadequacy, and anxiety can lead to thoughts of suicide.\n \n2. Develop coping and resiliency skills and self-esteem.\n \n3. Learn to listen, be honest, share feelings, and get help when communicating with friends who show signs of\nsuicidal intent.\n \n4. Identify trusted adults, school resources, and/or community crisis intervention resources where youth can get\nhelp and recognize that there is no stigma associated with seeking services for mental health, substance abuse,\nand/or suicide prevention.\nIntervention\nStudents shall be encouraged to notify a teacher, principal, counselor, or other adult when they are experiencing\nthoughts of suicide or when they suspect or have knowledge of another student's suicidal intentions.\nEvery statement regarding suicidal intent shall be taken seriously.

In addition, the\ncounselor may disclose information of a personal nature to psychotherapists, other health care providers, or the\nschool nurse for the sole purpose of referring the student for treatment. (Education Code 49602)\nSchool employees shall act only within the authorization and scope of their credential or license. An employee is not\nauthorized to diagnose or treat mental illness unless specifically licensed and employed to do so. (Education Code\n215)\nWhenever schools establish a peer counseling system to provide support for students, peer counselors shall receive\ntraining that includes identification of the warning signs of suicidal behavior and referral of a suicidal student to\nappropriate adults.\nWhen a suicide attempt or threat is reported, the principal or designee shall ensure student safety by taking the\nfollowing actions:\n1. Immediately securing medical treatment and/or mental health services as necessary\n \n2. Notifying law enforcement and/or other emergency assistance if a suicidal act is being actively threatened\n \n3. Keeping the student under continuous adult supervision until the parent/guardian and/or appropriate support\nagent or agency can be contacted and has the opportunity to intervene\n \n4. Removing other students from the immediate area as soon as possible\nThe principal or designee shall document the incident in writing, including the steps that the school took in response\nto the suicide attempt or threat.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall follow up with the parent/guardian and student in a timely manner to provide\n\nreferrals to appropriate services as needed. If the parent/guardian does not access treatment for the student, the\nSuperintendent or designee may meet with the parent/guardian to identify barriers to treatment and assist the family\nin providing follow-up care for the student. If follow-up care is still not provided, the Superintendent or designee\nshall consider whether it is necessary, pursuant to laws for mandated reporters of child neglect, to refer the matter\nto the local child protective services agency.\nFor any student returning to school after a mental health crisis, the principal or designee and/or school counselor\nmay meet with the parents/guardians and, if appropriate, with the student to discuss re-entry and appropriate next\nsteps to ensure the student's readiness for return to school and determine the need for ongoing support.\nPostvention\nIn the event that a student dies by suicide, the Superintendent or designee shall communicate with the student's\nparents/guardians to offer condolences, assistance, and resources.

The Superintendent or designee shall provide students,\nparents/guardians, and staff with information, counseling, and/or referrals to community agencies as needed. School\nstaff may receive assistance from school counselors or other mental health professionals in determining how best to\ndiscuss the suicide or attempted suicide with students.\nAny response to media inquiries shall be handled by the district-designated spokesperson who shall not divulge\nconfidential information. The district's response shall not sensationalize suicide and shall focus on the district's\npostvention plan and available resources.\nAfter any suicide or attempted suicide by a student, the Superintendent or designee shall provide an opportunity for\nall staff who responded to the incident to debrief, evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies used, and make\nrecommendations for future actions.\nIn support of the efforts to reduce youth suicide, and to help Districts prevent and respond to youth suicide, the San\nMateo County Office of Education (SMCOE) and San Mateo County Health System created the San Mateo County\nSchools Suicide Prevention Toolkit. The toolkit was developed through an extensive collaborative process involving\ncommunity stakeholders, school mental health professionals, and suicide prevention experts including staff from\nCounty Behavioral Health and Recovery Services (BHRS). It outlines guidelines for identifying, intervening, and\nresponding to suicidal and self-injurious students. It also offers best practices to school site crisis teams to be used in\nthe aftermath of a student death by suicide.\nThe toolkit is divided into three sections:\nThe first section provides guidelines regarding the training and education of staff, formation of a crisis response\nteam, signs of students at risk for suicide, student risk assessments, and responses to student self-injury,\nhospitalization, and suicide.\nThe second section provides important forms, including forms for use by mental health professionals and members of\nthe school site crisis response team and/or administration to evaluate, respond to, and document a suicide risk\nassessment; as well as forms documenting the release of a student to parents for psychiatric assessments and\nmaterials to provide to students and parents in the event of a suicide.\nThe final section of the toolkit contains the Return to School Information Packet that will help staff work with\nstudents and parents as a student transitions back to school after a suicide attempt or psychiatric hospitalization.\nTo ensure the policies regarding suicide prevention are properly adopted, implemented, and updated, the district\nshall appoint an individual (or team) to serve as the suicide prevention point of contact for the district. In addition,\neach school shall identify at least one staff member to serve as the liaison to the district's suicide prevention point of\ncontact, and coordinate and implement suicide prevention activities on their specific campus. This policy shall be\nreviewed and revised as indicated, at least annually in conjunction with the previously mentioned community\nstakeholders.\nTo the extent possible, parents/guardians/caregivers should be included in all suicide prevention efforts. At a\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nminimum, schools shall share with parents/guardians/caregivers the Redwood City School District suicide prevention\npolicy and procedures.\nThis suicide prevention policy shall be prominently displayed on the Redwood City School District Web page and\nincluded in the parent handbook.\nParents/guardians/caregivers should be invited to provide input on the development and implementation of this\npolicy.\nAll parents/guardians/caregivers should have access to suicide prevention training that addresses the following:\nSuicide risk factors, warning signs, and protective factors;\nHow to talk with a student about thoughts of suicide;\nHow to respond appropriately to the student who has suicidal thoughts. Such responses shall include constant\nsupervision of any student judged to be at risk for suicide and referral for an immediate suicide risk assessment.",

      "content": "A student identified as an individual with disabilities pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)\nis subject to the same grounds for suspension and expulsion which apply to students without disabilities.\nProcedures for Students Not Yet Eligible for Special Education Services\nA student who has not been officially identified as a student with disabilities pursuant to IDEA and who has engaged\nin behavior that violated the district's code of student conduct may assert any of the protections under IDEA only if\nthe district had knowledge that the student is disabled before the behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action\noccurred. (20 USC 1415(k)(5); 34 CFR 300.534)\nThe district shall be deemed to have knowledge that the student has a disability if one of the following conditions\nexists: (20 USC 1415(k)(5); 34 CFR 300.534)\n1. The parent/guardian has expressed concern to district supervisory or administrative personnel in writing, or to\na teacher of the student, that the student is in need of special education or related services.\n \n2. The parent/guardian has requested an evaluation of the student for special education pursuant to 34 CFR\n300.300-300.311.\n \n3. The teacher of the student or other district personnel has expressed specific concerns directly to the district's\ndirector of special education or to other supervisory district personnel about a pattern of behavior\ndemonstrated by the student.\nThe district would be deemed to not have knowledge that a student is disabled if the parent/guardian has not\nallowed the student to be evaluated for special education services or has refused services. In addition, the district\nwould be deemed to not have knowledge if the district conducted an evaluation pursuant to 34 CFR\n300.300-300.311 and determined that the student was not an individual with a disability. When the district is\ndeemed to not have knowledge of the disability, the student shall be disciplined in accordance with procedures\nestablished for students without disabilities who engage in comparable behavior. (20 USC 1415(k)(5); 34 CFR\n300.534)\nIf a request is made for an evaluation of a student during the time period in which the student is subject to\ndisciplinary measures pursuant to 34 CFR 300.530, the evaluation shall be conducted in an expedited manner. Until\nthe evaluation is completed, the student shall remain in the educational placement determined by school authorities.\n(20 USC 1415(k)(5); 34 CFR 300.534)\nSuspension\nThe Superintendent or designee may suspend a student with a disability for up to 10 consecutive school days for a\nsingle incident of misconduct, and for up to 20 school days in a school year, as long as the suspension(s) does not\nconstitute a change in placement pursuant to 34 CFR 300.536. (Education Code 48903; 34 CFR 300.530)\nThe principal or designee shall monitor the number of days, including portions of days, in which a student with a valid\nindividualized education program (IEP) has been suspended during the school year.\nThe district shall determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a pattern of removals of a student from his/her current\neducational placement for disciplinary reasons constitutes a change of placement. A change of placement shall be\ndeemed to have occurred under any of the following circumstances: (34 CFR 300.536)\n1. The removal is for more than 10 consecutive school days.\n \n2. The student has been subjected to a series of removals that constitute a pattern because of all of the\nfollowing:\n \na. The series of removals total more than 10 school days in a school year.\n \nb. The student's behavior is substantially similar to his/her behavior in previous incidents that resulted in\nthe series of removals.\n \nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nc. Additional factors, such as the length of each removal, the total amount of time the student has been\nremoved, and the proximity of the removals to one another, indicate a change of placement.\nIf the removal has been determined to be a change of placement as specified in items #1-2 above, the student's IEP\nteam shall determine the appropriate educational services. (34 CFR 300.530)\nServices During Suspension\nAny student suspended for more than 10 school days in the same school year shall continue to receive services\nduring the term of the suspension. School personnel, in consultation with at least one of the student's teachers, shall\ndetermine the extent to which services are needed as provided in 34 CFR 300.101(a), so as to enable the student to\ncontinue to participate in the general education curriculum in another setting and to progress toward meeting the\ngoals as set out in his/her IEP. (20 USC 1412(a)(1)(A); 34 CFR 300.530)\nIf a student with disabilities is excluded from school bus transportation, the student shall be provided with an\nalternative form of transportation at no cost to the student or his/her parent/guardian, provided that transportation\nis specified in his/her IEP. (Education Code 48915.5)\nInterim Alternative Educational Placement Due to Dangerous Behavior\nThe district may unilaterally place a student with a disability in an appropriate interim alternative educational setting\nfor up to 45 school days, without regard to whether the behavior is a manifestation of the student's disability, when\nthe student commits one of the following acts while at school, going to or from school, or at a school-related\nfunction: (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(G); 34 CFR 300.530)\n1. Carries or possesses a weapon, as defined in 18 USC 930\n \n2. Knowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs\n \n3. Sells or solicits the sale of a controlled substance as identified in 21 USC 812(c), Schedules I-V\n \n4. Inflicts serious bodily injury upon another person as defined in 18 USC 1365\nThe student's interim alternative educational setting shall be determined by his/her IEP team. (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(G),\n34 CFR 300.531)\nOn the date the decision to take disciplinary action is made, the parents/guardians of the student shall be notified of\nthe decision and provided the procedural safeguards notice pursuant to 34 CFR 300.504. (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(H); 34\nCFR 300.530)\nA student who has been removed from his/her current placement because of dangerous behavior shall receive\nservices to the extent necessary to allow him/her to participate in the general education curriculum and to progress\ntoward meeting the goals set out in his/her IEP. As appropriate, the student shall also receive a functional behavioral\nassessment and behavioral intervention services and modifications that are designed to address the behavior\nviolation so that it does not recur. (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(D); 34 CFR 300.530)\nManifestation Determination\nThe following procedural safeguards shall apply when a student is suspended for more than 10 consecutive school\ndays, when a series of removals of a student constitutes a pattern, or when a change of placement of a student is\ncontemplated due to a violation of the district's code of conduct:\n1. Notice: On the date the decision to take disciplinary action is made, the parents/guardians of the student shall\nbe notified of the decision and provided the procedural safeguards notice pursuant to 34 CFR 300.504. (20\nUSC 1415(k)(1)(H); 34 CFR 300.530)\n \n2. Manifestation Determination Review: Immediately if possible, but in no case later than 10 school days after\nthe date the decision to take disciplinary action is made, a manifestation determination review shall be made of\nthe relationship between the student's disability and the behavior subject to the disciplinary action. (20 USC\n1415(k)(1)(E); 34 CFR 300.530)\n\u200bAt the manifestation determination review, the district, the student's parent/guardian, and relevant members\nof the IEP team (as determined by the district and parent/guardian) shall review all relevant information in the\nstudent's file, including the student's IEP, any teacher observations, and any relevant information provided by\n\nthe parents/guardians, to determine whether the conduct in question was either of the following: (20 USC\n1415(k)(1)(E); 34 CFR 300.530)\n \na. Caused by or had a direct and substantial relationship to the student's disability\n \nb. A direct result of the district's failure to implement the student's IEP, in which case the district shall take\nimmediate steps to remedy those deficiencies\nIf the manifestation review team determines that a condition in either #a or #b above was met, the\nconduct shall then be determined to be a manifestation of the student's disability. (20 USC 1415(k)(1)(E);\n34 CFR 300.530)\n \n3. Determination that Behavior is a Manifestation of the Student's Disability: When the conduct has been\ndetermined to be a manifestation of the student's disability, the IEP team shall conduct a functional behavioral\nassessment, unless a functional behavioral assessment had been conducted before the occurrence of the\nbehavior that resulted in the change of placement, and shall implement a behavioral intervention plan for the\nstudent.

      "content": "The Board of Education is committed to providing a safe, supportive, and positive school environment which is\nconducive to student learning and to preparing students for responsible citizenship by fostering self-discipline and\npersonal responsibility. The Board believes that high expectations for student behavior, effective school and\nclassroom management strategies and parent involvement can minimize the need for disciplinary measures that\nexclude students from instruction as a means for correcting student misbehavior. Staff shall use preventative\nmeasures and positive conflict resolution techniques whenever possible.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall develop effective, age-appropriate strategies for maintaining a positive school\nclimate and correcting student misbehavior at district schools. The strategies shall focus on providing students with\nneeded supports; communicating clear, appropriate, and consistent expectations and consequences for student\nconduct; and ensuring equity and continuous improvement in the implementation of district discipline policies and\npractices.\nIn addition, the Superintendent or designee's strategies for correcting student misconduct shall reflect the Board's\npreference for the use of positive interventions and alternative disciplinary measures over exclusionary discipline\nmeasures.\nDisciplinary measures that may result in loss of instructional time or cause students to be disengaged from school,\nsuch as detention, suspension, and expulsion, shall be imposed only when required or permitted by law or when\nother means of correction have been documented to have failed. (Education Code 48900.5)\nSchool personnel and volunteers shall not allow any disciplinary action taken against a student to result in the denial\nor delay of a school meal. (Education Code 49557.5)\nThe Superintendent or designee shall create a model discipline matrix that lists violations and the consequences for\neach as allowed by law.\nThe administrative staff at each school may develop disciplinary rules to meet the school's particular needs\nconsistent with law, Board policy, and district regulations. The Board, at an open meeting, shall review the approved\nschool discipline rules for consistency with Board policy and state law. Site-level disciplinary rules shall be included in\nthe district's comprehensive safety plan. (Education Code 32282, 35291.5)\nAt all times, the safety of students and staff and the maintenance of an orderly school environment shall be priorities\nin determining appropriate discipline. When misconduct occurs, staff shall implement appropriate discipline and\nattempt to identify and address the causes of the student's behavior. When choosing between different disciplinary\nstrategies, staff shall consider the effect of each option on the student's health, well-being, and opportunity to learn.\nStaff shall enforce disciplinary rules fairly, consistently and without discrimination.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall provide professional development as necessary to assist staff in developing the\nskills needed to effectively implement the disciplinary strategies adopted for district schools, including, but not\nlimited to, consistent school and classroom management skills, effective accountability and positive intervention\ntechniques, and development of strong, cooperative relationships with parents/guardians.\nDistrict goals for improving school climate, based on suspension and expulsion rates, surveys of students, staff, and\nparents/guardians regarding their sense of school safety, and other local measures, shall be included in the district's\nlocal control and accountability plan, as required by law.\nAt the beginning of each school year, the Superintendent or designee shall report to the Board regarding disciplinary\nstrategies used in district schools in the immediately preceding school year and their effect on student learning.",

In addition,\nany student who observes any such incident is strongly encouraged to report the incident to the compliance officer\nor principal, whether or not the alleged victim files a complaint.\nAny school employee who observes an incident of unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment,\nintimidation, retaliation, or bullying, or to whom such an incident is reported shall report the incident to the\ncompliance officer or principal within a school day, whether or not the alleged victim files a complaint.\nAny school employee who witnesses an incident of unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment,\nintimidation, retaliation, or bullying, shall immediately intervene to stop the incident when it is safe to do so.\n(Education Code 234.1)\nWhen a report of unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, retaliation, or bullying, is\nmade to or received by the principal or compliance officer, the principal or compliance officer shall notify the student\nor parent/guardian of the right to file a formal complaint in accordance with AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint\nProcedures or, for complaints of sexual harassment that meet the federal Title IX definition, AR 5145.71 - Title IX\nSexual Harassment Complaint Procedures.

Any interim\nmeasures adopted to address unlawful discrimination shall, to the extent possible, not disadvantage the complainant\nor a student who is the victim of the alleged unlawful discrimination.\nAny report or complaint alleging unlawful discrimination by the principal, compliance officer, or any other person to\nwhom a report would ordinarily be made or complaint filed shall instead be made to or filed with the Superintendent\nor designee who shall determine how the complaint will be investigated.\nIssues Unique to Intersex, Nonbinary, Transgender and Gender-Nonconforming Students\nGender identity of a student means the student's gender-related identity, appearance, or behavior as determined from\nthe student's internal sense of their gender, whether or not that gender-related identity, appearance, or behavior is\ndifferent from that traditionally associated with the student's physiology or assigned sex at birth.\nGender expression means a student's gender-related appearance and behavior, whether stereotypically associated\nwith the student's assigned sex at birth. (Education Code 210.7)\nGender transition refers to the process in which a student changes from living and identifying as the sex assigned to\nthe student at birth to living and identifying as the sex that corresponds to the student's gender identity.\nGender-nonconforming student means a student whose gender expression differs from stereotypical expectations.\nIntersex student means a student with natural bodily variations in anatomy, hormones, chromosomes, and other traits\nthat differ from expectations generally associated with female and male bodies.\nNonbinary student means a student whose gender identity falls outside the traditional conception of strictly either\nfemale or male, regardless of whether or not the student identifies as transgender, was born with intersex traits, uses\ngender-neutral pronouns, or uses agender, genderqueer, pangender, gender-nonconforming, gender variant, or such\nother more specific term to describe their gender.\nTransgender student means a student whose gender identity is different from the gender they were assigned at birth.\nThe district prohibits acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility that are based on sex,\n\ngender identity, or gender expression, or that have the purpose or effect of producing a negative impact on the\nstudent's academic performance or of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive educational environment,\nregardless of whether the acts are sexual in nature. Examples of the types of conduct which are prohibited in the\ndistrict and which may constitute gender-based harassment include, but are not limited to:\n1. Refusing to address a student by a name and the pronouns consistent with their gender identity\n \n2. Disciplining or disparaging a student or excluding them from participating in activities for behavior or\nappearance that is consistent with their gender identity or that does not conform to stereotypical notions of\nmasculinity or femininity, as applicable\n \n3. Blocking a student's entry to the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity\n \n4. Taunting a student because they participate in an athletic activity more typically favored by a student of the\nother sex\n \n5. Revealing a student's gender identity status to individuals who do not have a legitimate need for the\ninformation, without the student's consent\n \n6. Using gender-specific slurs\n \n7. Physically assaulting a student motivated by hostility toward them because of their gender, gender identity, or\ngender expression\nThe district's uniform complaint procedures (AR 1312.3) or Title IX sexual harassment procedures (AR 5145.71), as\napplicable, shall be used to report and resolve complaints alleging discrimination against intersex, nonbinary,\ntransgender and gender-nonconforming students.\nExamples of bases for complaints include, but are not limited to, the above list, as well as improper rejection by the\ndistrict of a student's asserted gender identity, denial of access to facilities that correspond with a student's gender\nidentity, improper disclosure of a student's gender identity, discriminatory enforcement of a dress code, and other\ninstances of gender- based harassment.\nTo ensure that intersex, nonbinary, transgender and gender-nonconforming students are afforded the same rights,\nbenefits, and protections provided to all students by law and Board policy, the district shall address each situation on\na case-by-case basis, in accordance with the following guidelines:\n1. Right to privacy: A student's intersex, nonbinary, transgender, or gender-nonconforming status is the student's\nprivate information. The district shall develop strategies to prevent unauthorized disclosure of students'\nprivate information. Such strategies may include, but are not limited to, collecting or maintaining information\nabout student gender only when relevant to the educational program or activity, protecting or revealing a\nstudent's gender identity as necessary to protect the health or safety of the student, and keeping a student's\nunofficial record separate from the official record.\nThe district shall only disclose the information to others with the student's prior written consent, except when\nthe disclosure is otherwise required by law or when the district has compelling evidence that disclosure is\nnecessary to preserve the student's physical or mental well-being. In any case, the district shall only allow\ndisclosure of a student's personally identifiable information to employees with a legitimate educational interest\nas determined by the district pursuant to 34 CFR 99.31. Any district employee to whom a student's intersex,\nnonbinary, transgender, or gender-nonconforming status is disclosed shall keep the student's information\nconfidential. When disclosure of a student's gender identity is made to a district employee by a student, the\nemployee shall seek the student's permission to notify the compliance officer. If the student refuses to give\npermission, the employee shall keep the student's information confidential, unless the employee is required to\ndisclose or report the student's information pursuant to this administrative regulation, and shall inform the\nstudent that honoring the student's request may limit the district's ability to meet the student's needs related\nto the student's status as an intersex, nonbinary, transgender, or gender-nonconforming student. If the student\npermits the employee to notify the compliance officer, the employee shall do so within three school days.\nAs appropriate given the student's need for support, the compliance officer may discuss with the student any\nneed to disclose the student's intersex, nonbinary, transgender or gender- nonconformity status or gender\nidentity or gender expression to their parents/guardians and/or others, including other students, teacher(s), or\nother adults on campus. The district shall offer support services, such as counseling, to students who wish to\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\ninform their parents/guardians of their status and desire assistance in doing so.\n \n2. Determining a Student's Gender Identity: The compliance officer shall accept the student's assertion of their\ngender identity and begin to treat the student consistent with their gender identity unless district personnel\npresent a credible and supportable basis for believing that the student's assertion is for an improper purpose.\n \n3. Addressing a Student's Transition Needs: The compliance officer shall arrange a meeting with the student and,\nif appropriate, their parents/guardians to identify and develop strategies for ensuring that the student's access\nto education programs and activities is maintained. The meeting shall discuss the intersex, nonbinary,\ntransgender or gender-nonconforming student's rights and how those rights may affect and be affected by the\nrights of other students and shall address specific subjects related to the student's access to facilities and to\nacademic or educational support programs, services, or activities, including, but not limited to, sports and other\ncompetitive endeavors. In addition, the compliance officer shall identify specific school site employee(s) to\nwhom the student may report any problem related to their status as an intersex, nonbinary, transgender or\ngender-nonconforming individual, so that prompt action can be taken to address it. Alternatively, if appropriate\nand desired by the student, the school may form a support team for the student that will meet periodically to\nassess whether the arrangements for the student are meeting their educational needs and providing equal\naccess to programs and activities, educate appropriate staff about the student's transition, and serve as a\nresource to the student to better protect the student from gender-based discrimination.\n \n4. Accessibility to Sex-Segregated Facilities, Programs, and Activities: When the district maintains sex-segregated\nfacilities, such as restrooms and locker rooms, or offers sex-segregated programs and activities, such as\nphysical education classes, intermural sports, and interscholastic athletic programs, students shall be permitted\nto access facilities and participate in programs and activities consistent with their gender identity. To address\nany student's privacy concerns in using sex-segregated facilities, the district shall offer available options such\nas a gender-neutral or single-use restroom or changing area, a bathroom stall with a door, an area in the locker\nroom separated by a curtain or screen, access to a staff member's office, or use of the locker room before or\nafter the other students. However, the district shall not require a student to utilize these options because the\nstudent is intersex, nonbinary, transgender or gender-nonconforming. In addition, a student shall be permitted\nto participate in accordance with their gender identity in other circumstances where students are separated by\ngender, such as for class discussions, yearbook pictures, and field trips. A student's right to participate in a sex-\nsegregated activity in accordance with their gender identity shall not render invalid or inapplicable any other\neligibility rule established for participation in the activity.\n \n5. Upon each student's enrollment, the district is required to maintain a mandatory permanent student record\n(official record) that includes the student's gender and legal name.\nA student's legal name as entered on the mandatory student record required pursuant to 5 CCR 432 shall only\nbe changed with proper documentation. A student's gender as entered on the student's official record required\npursuant to 5 CCR 432 shall only be changed with written authorization of a parent/guardian having legal\ncustody of the student. (Education Code 49061)\nHowever, when proper documentation or authorization, as applicable, is not submitted with a request to\nchange a student's legal name or gender, any change to the student's record shall be limited to the student's\nunofficial records such as attendance sheets, report cards, and school identification.\n \n6. Names and Pronouns: If a student so chooses, district personnel shall be required to address the student by a\nname and the pronoun(s) consistent with their gender identity, without the necessity of a court order or a\nchange to their official district record. However, inadvertent slips or honest mistakes by district personnel in\nthe use of the student's name and/or consistent pronouns will, in general, not constitute a violation of this\nadministrative regulation or the accompanying district policy.\n \n7. Uniforms/Dress Code: A student has the right to dress in a manner consistent with their gender identity,\nsubject to any dress code adopted on a school site.",

The Superintendent or designee shall send parents/guardians all notifications required by law and any \nother notifications the Superintendent or designee believes will promote familial understanding and involvement.\nNotice of the rights and responsibilities of parents/guardians as specified in Education Code 48980 shall be sent at the \nbeginning of each academic year and may be provided by regular mail, in electronic form when so requested by the \nparent/guardian, or by any other method normally used by the district for written communication with \nparents/guardians. (Education Code 48981)\nNo activity specified in Education Code 48980 shall be undertaken with respect to any particular student unless the \nstudent's parent/guardian has been informed of such action through the annual notification or other separate special \nnotification. Such notice shall state the activity that will be undertaken and the approximate date on which the activity \nwill occur. (Education Code 48983-48984)\nThe annual notification shall include a request that the parent/guardian sign the notice and return it to the school or, if \nthe notice is provided in electronic format, that the parent/guardian submit a signed acknowledgement of receipt of the \nnotice to the school. The parent/guardian's signature is not required. Any signature is an acknowledgment of receipt of \nthe information but does not indicate that consent to participate in any particular program has been given or withheld. \n(Education Code 48982)\nWhenever a student enrolls in a district school during the school year, the student's parents/guardians shall be given all \nrequired parental notifications at that time.\nNotifications shall be presented in an understandable and uniform format. When necessary, the district shall provide \nnotifications to qualified individuals with disabilities in alternative formats, such as braille, large font, or audio \nrecordings, to enable such individuals to effectively participate in any program, service, or activity, as required by law.\nWhenever 15 percent or more of the students enrolled in a district school speak a single primary language other than \nEnglish, as determined from the California Department of Education census data collected pursuant to Education Code \n52164, all notices sent to the parent/guardian of any such student shall, in addition to being written in English, be \nwritten in the primary language, and may be responded to either in English or the primary language. (Education Code \n48981, 48985)\nWhenever an employee learns that a student's parent/guardian is unable to understand the district's printed notifications \nfor any reason, the employee shall inform the principal or designee, who shall work with the parent/guardian to \nestablish other appropriate means of communication.",

A clear message that, regardless of a complainant's noncompliance with the writing, timeline, or other formal\nfiling requirements, every sexual harassment allegation that involves a student, whether as the complainant,\nrespondent, or victim of the harassment, shall be investigated and prompt action shall be taken to stop any\nharassment, prevent recurrence, and address any continuing effect on students\n \n6. Information about the district's procedure for investigating complaints and the person(s) to whom a report of\nsexual harassment should be made\n \n7. Information about the rights of students and parents/guardians to file a civil or criminal complaint, as\napplicable, including the right to file a civil or criminal complaint while the district investigation of a sexual\nharassment complaint continues\n \n8.

Early education programs should provide developmentally appropriate activities in a safe, adequately\nsupervised, and cognitively rich environment.\nCollaboration with Community Programs\nThe Superintendent or designee shall collaborate with the local child care and development planning council, other\npublic agencies, organizations, the county office of education, and/or private preschool providers to assess the\navailability of preschool programs in the community and the extent to which the community's preschool needs are\nbeing met. The Board encourages the development of a comprehensive districtwide and/or countywide plan to\nincrease children's access to high-quality preschool programs.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall provide information about preschool options in the community to\nparents/guardians upon request.\nDistrict Preschool Programs\nWhen the Board determines that it is feasible, the district may contract with the California Department of Education\n(CDE) to provide preschool services in facilities at or near district schools.\nThe Board shall approve for the district's preschool program a written philosophical statement, goals, and objectives\nthat reflect the cultural and linguistic characteristics of the families to be served and address the program\ncomponents specified in 5 CCR 18272-18281 and the accompanying administrative regulation.

As necessary, the Superintendent or designee\nshall provide information to the Board regarding facilities financing options for preschool classrooms and/or facilities\navailable through partnering organizations or agencies.\nBecause parents/guardians are essential partners in supporting the development of their children, the\nSuperintendent or designee shall involve them in program planning.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall coordinate planning efforts for the district's preschool program, transitional\nkindergarten program, and elementary education program to provide a developmental continuum that builds upon\nchildren's growing skills and knowledge.\nThe district's program shall be aligned with preschool learning foundations and curriculum frameworks developed by\nthe CDE which identify the knowledge, skills, and competencies that children typically attain as they complete their\nfirst or second year of preschool. The program shall be designed to facilitate children's development in essential skills\nrelated to language and literacy, mathematics, physical development, health, visual and performing arts, science,\nhistory-social science, English language development, and social-emotional development.\nThe district's preschool program shall provide appropriate services to support the needs of English learners and\nchildren with disabilities.\nThe district shall encourage volunteerism in the program and shall communicate frequently with parents/guardians of\nenrolled children regarding their child's progress.\nTo maximize the ability of children to succeed in the preschool program, the program shall support children's health\nthrough proper nutrition and physical activity and shall provide or make referrals to available health and social\nservices as needed.\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nThe Superintendent or designee shall ensure that administrators, teachers, and paraprofessionals in district preschool\nprograms possess the appropriate permit(s) issued by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, meet any additional\nqualifications established by the Board, and participate in professional development opportunities designed to\ncontinually enhance their knowledge and skills.\nPreschool admissions policies and procedures shall be in writing and available to the public. Such policies and\nprocedures shall include criteria designating those children whose needs can be met by the program and services, the\nages of children who will be accepted, program activities, any supplementary services provided, any field trip\nprovisions, any transportation arrangements, food service provisions, and a health examination requirement. (CCR\n18105; 22 CCR 101218)\nThe Superintendent or designee shall ensure that subsidized preschool is provided to eligible families to the extent\nthat state and/or federal funding is available and shall establish enrollment priorities in accordance with Education\nCode 8263 and 5 CCR 18106.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall recommend strategies to link the district's preschool program with other\navailable child care and development programs in the district or community in order to assist families whose child\ncare needs extend beyond the length of time that the district's part-day and full-day preschool program is offered.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall develop and implement an annual plan of evaluation which conforms to state\nrequirements. (5 CCR 18279)\nThe Superintendent or designee shall regularly report to the Board regarding enrollments in district preschool\nprograms and the effectiveness of the programs in preparing preschoolers for transition into the elementary\neducation program.",

      "content": "Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer + (LGBTQ+) \nPURPOSE\nThe Governing Board strives to create and maintain a safe, supportive, and inclusive learning environment for all\nstudents and to ensure that every student has equal access to the District\u2019s educational programs and activities. This\nregulation specifically advises RCSD staff regarding issues related to students of all sexual orientations, gender\nidentities, and gender expressions.\nDEFINITIONS\nThese definitions are intended as functional descriptors rather than labels for any student. Students may or may not\nuse these terms to describe themselves.\nGender: Socially determined characteristics, roles, behaviors, and attributes a society expects from and considers\nappropriate for males and females; these characteristics are often referred to as \u201cfeminine\u201d and \u201cmasculine.\u201d Under\nCalifornia law, \u201cgender\u201d is defined to include a person's gender identity. (Cal. Ed. Code \u00a7 210.7)\nGender Identity: A person\u2019s core, hard-wired internal sense of their own sex. Though our society traditionally\nrecognized only two genders (male and female), understanding of gender has expanded beyond the binary to\nrecognition of gender fluidity, inclusive of: agender, genderqueer, pangender, transgender, etc. All people have a\ngender identity.\nGender Expression: An individual\u2019s gender-related appearance and behavior, whether or not stereotypically\nassociated with the individual\u2019s assigned sex at birth. (Education Code 210.7)\nGender Nonconforming: Displaying gender traits that are not consistent with stereotypical characteristics associated\nwith one\u2019s sex assigned at birth, or others\u2019 perceptions of that sex. This term can be used to describe people whose\ngender expression differs from stereotypical expectations about how boys and girls look or act.\nNon-binary (also genderqueer): An individual whose gender identity or gender expression falls outside or in between\nthe category of male or female. Non-binary and genderqueer are umbrella terms that include genderfluid, bigender\nand agender, among other gender identities. Individuals who identify with these terms may exhibit different gender\nexpressions over time.\nCisgender: An individual whose gender identity aligns with their assigned sex at birth.\nTransgender: An individual whose gender identity is different from that traditionally associated with the assigned sex\nat birth.\nAgender (also genderless, non-gender and neutrois): An individual whose gender identity does not define them as\nhaving a particular sex or has a gender identity that is neutral.\nLGBTQ+: An umbrella term that stands for \u201clesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and represents inclusivity of\nmany other identities in the community\u201d.\nSex Assigned at Birth: The sex designated by a physician, typically based on the appearance of the infant\u2019s body at\nbirth.\nGender Marker: Letters that denote a person\u2019s sex. Gender markers most commonly appear on identity documents.\nGender markers may not accurately reflect a transgender person\u2019s sex unless they were able to correct that\ndesignation with agency that issued the identity document.\nGender Support Plan: A document co-created with school staff, caregivers and the student to share understandings\nabout the ways in which the LGBTQ+ student\u2019s authentic gender will be accounted for and supported at school.\n(Refer to Appendix A for Gender Support Plan template.)\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nGender Transition describes the experience by which a transgender individual brings their outer appearance into\ncloser alignment with their gender identity. This may include changing their name, clothing, and hairstyle to be\nconsistent with their gender identity.\nSexual Orientation: An individual\u2019s romantic or sexual attraction to people of the other and/or same gender. (Cal. Ed.\nCode \u00a7 212.6) Common terms used to describe sexual orientation include, but are not limited to, heterosexual,\nlesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, queer, and asexual. Sexual orientation and gender identity are different.\nTransgender individuals, just like cisgender individuals, may identify with any sexual orientation.\nGender-based Harassment: Includes but is not limited to unwelcome or demeaning conduct or comments directed at\nor about an individual on the basis of actual or perceived gender, gender identity and gender expression, sex, sexual\norientation, or other related personal characteristics, or on the basis of association with a person or group with one\nor more of these actual or perceived characteristics. Intentionally calling a transgender person by their old name and\npronouns is a form of harassment and will be treated as such. Gender-based harassment is a form of harassment on\nthe basis of sex pursuant to the provisions in BP 5145.7 and AR 1312.3.\nScope\nThis regulation seeks to ensure a safe and supportive learning environment for all students, including transgender\nand gender nonconforming students, by prohibiting on, including discriminatory harassment, based on actual or\nperceived sexual orientation, gender- identity, or gender expression. This regulation applies to stakeholders\nincluding, but are not limited to, English Learner Advisory Council, District English Learner Advisory Council, Parent\nTeacher Association, Parent Teacher Organization, and organizations providing services before, during, or after\nschool including district personnel, as well as volunteers (Cal. Ed. Code \u00a7 48900(r)).\nThough an incident of alleged unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, retaliation\nor bullying as defined within this regulation may occur off campus, if the effects of the off-campus incident result in\nunlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, retaliation or bullying at school that is\nsufficiently serious to interfere with or limit the targeted student\u2019s ability to participate in or benefit from the\neducation program, the school must respond promptly and effectively to eliminate the harassment that occurs at\nschool, prevent its recurrence, and address its effects.\nThis regulation also pertains to electronic acts or the creation or transmission originated on or off the school site, by\nmeans of an electronic device. \u201cElectronic act\u201d means the transmission, by means of an electronic device, including,\nbut not limited to, a telephone, wireless telephone or other wireless communication device, computer, or pager, of a\ncommunication, including but not limited to, any of the following:\n1. A message, text, sound, or image.\n \n2. A post on a social network internet web site including, but not limited to:\n \na. Posting to or creating a burn page. \u201cBurn page\u201d means an Internet web site created for the purpose of\nhaving one or more of the effects listed above\n \nb. Creating a credible impersonation of another actual pupil for the purpose of having one or more of the\neffects listed above. \u201cCredible impersonation\u201d means to knowingly and without consent impersonate a\npupil for the purpose of bullying the pupil and such that another pupil would reasonably believe, or has\nreasonably believed, that the pupil was or is the pupil who was impersonated.\n \nc. Creating a false profile for the purpose of having one or more of the effects listed above. \u201cFalse profile\u201d\nmeans a profile of a fictitious pupil or a profile using the likeness or attributes of an actual pupil other\nthan the pupil who created the false profile. (AR 5131.2)\nGender Support Plan/ Addressing a Student\u2019s Transition Needs\nThe responsibility for determining a student\u2019s gender identity rests with the student. A school shall accept a student\u2019s\nasserted gender identity. A school may not question or disregard the student\u2019s assertion of their gender identity.\nWhen requested, a school site employee with knowledge of the student shall arrange a meeting with the student\nand, if appropriate, the student\u2019s parents/guardians to identify student needs, including transition-related issues, and\ndevelop a Gender Support Plan.\nGender Support Plan Components\n\nParent/Guardian Involvement including special considerations if parent/guardian is not supportive.\nConfidentiality, Privacy and Disclosure of student\u2019s gender and the student\u2019s right to decide when and with whom\nthe information is shared.\nStudent Safety that includes at least one adult on campus the student will go to and expectations if the student is not\nfeeling safe.\nNames, Pronouns and Student Records that includes name and gender marker for the student\u2019s identity documents.\nInformation will include maintaining a student\u2019s privacy.\nUse of Facilities to identify which restrooms the student will use, location for clothing changes if needed, and student\naccess to facilities.\nExtra Curricular Activities and supports needed for participation.\nOther considerations that may include siblings, dress code, social dynamics with other students, and training that the\nschool may need to build capacity for gender inclusive settings.\nSupport Plan Review and Revision to include when and who will monitor.\nPrivacy\nDistrict and school personnel shall not disclose a student\u2019s transgender status to others, including, but not limited to,\nother students, parents, and/or other school personnel, unless they are legally required to, or the student has\nauthorized such disclosure, or there is a specific and compelling \u201cneed to know\u201d in order to protect the transgender\nstudent\u2019s interests. In those rare circumstances where disclosure is deemed to be necessary, before making any\ndisclosure, school officials should inform the transgender student of the need to disclose and provide them with the\nopportunity and resources they may need to make the disclosure themselves.\nCare must be taken to protect student privacy. School personnel should not assume that a student who is \"out\" in\nsome contexts (e.g. within a classroom) is \"out\" everywhere (e.g. on a sports team). School personnel should also not\nassume that a student who is \u201cout\u201d now (e.g. in middle school) would still want to be \u201cout\u201d in the future (e.g. high\nschool). School personnel should work with students, if they desire, to develop a plan for \u201ccoming out\u201d to their\nfriends and teachers.\nNames/Pronouns\nShould a student or parent/legal guardian request to have the student addressed by a name and pronoun different\nfrom those given at birth, the school shall honor that request and set expectations for their consistent use. District\nand school officials may not require proof of a court-ordered name or gender change before honoring such a request.\nThe District and schools will adapt the student information system to accommodate requested names and pronouns\nto prevent inadvertently revealing information that would violate the student\u2019s privacy.\nWhile inadvertent slips or honest mistakes in the use of names or pronouns may occur at first, staff or students\u2019\nintentional refusal to respect a student\u2019s gender identity by using the wrong name and gender pronoun (sometimes\ncalled \u201cmisgendering\u201d) is discriminatory, a form of harassment, and a violation of this regulation.\nSchool Records\nThe District shall maintain an official, permanent pupil record with the legal name and gender appearing on the\nstudent\u2019s birth certificate. Schools should use a transgender student\u2019s requested name and gender pronoun on all\nother school-related records or documents. This includes physical records and documents, diplomas and other\ncertificates of advancement, electronic records and documents, and school IDs. Every effort should be made to\nupdate student records with the student\u2019s requested name and gender pronoun or gender marker, and not to\ncirculate records with the student\u2019s assigned birth name or gender marker. Schools should also identify routine areas\nwhere a transgender student\u2019s privacy could be violated by the improper usage of the legal name and gender marker.\nThese include but are not limited to pre-printed labels, standardized tests, student IDs or library cards, lunch tickets,\nschool photos, notices from the main office, attendance slips, grade books, posted lists of student names, lesson\nplans, seating charts and roll sheets used by substitute teachers, and any other places where students\u2019 names are\n\ncommonly written.\nWhen a student or parent/legal guardian presents the school with documentation of a court- ordered legal name\nand/or gender change, the school must then change the official, permanent pupil record, to reflect the student\u2019s new\nlegal name and gender, in a timely manner.\nTransgender students who transition after having graduated may ask their previous schools to amend school records\nor a diploma or transcript that include the student\u2019s birth name and gender. When requested, schools shall amend the\nstudent\u2019s record, including reissuing a diploma or transcript, to reflect the student\u2019s\ncurrent name and gender, upon receipt of documentation of a legal name or gender change.\nRestroom Availability\nAll students will be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice based on their gender identity. No student shall be\ncompelled to use such a restroom or denied access to gendered restrooms for any reason: cisgender students, if they\nor their parents are concerned for their privacy, can choose to use available single-stall restrooms.\nThe District will convert all single-stall restrooms to gender-neutral restrooms, providing, at a minimum, one gender\nneutral bathroom for every campus which will be available to all students regardless of underlying reason. When\npossible, multi-building campuses should have a minimum of one gender-neutral bathroom per building to\naccommodate students. When possible, the District will take care that the manner and type of bathroom used will\nnot isolate students who use them.\nAs a proactive measure, administrators should take steps to identify private gender- neutral restrooms on their\ncampus, as well as to de-stigmatize the use of such private options.\nEstablishing clear guidelines and expectations with regards to students\u2019 physical privacy and boundaries is also\nimportant. Both can be reinforced through language in student handbooks, posted expectations, and thorough\norientation and other processes for familiarizing students and guardians to the school and its facilities.\nLocker Room Accessibility\nSchools may maintain separate locker room facilities for male and female students. However, students shall have\naccess to the locker room facility that corresponds to their gender identity.\nIf any student has a need or desire for increased privacy or safety, regardless of the underlying reason, when possible\nthey may be provided access to a reasonable alternative changing area or locker room such as:\nUse of a private area in the public area of the locker room facility (i.e., a nearby restroom stall with a door, an\narea separated by a curtain, or a P.E. instructor\u2019s office in the locker room).\n \nA separate changing schedule (either utilizing the locker room before or after other students).\n \nUse of a nearby private area (i.e., a nearby restroom or a health office restroom).\nHowever, use of such an alternative changing space shall be a matter of choice for a student, and no student shall be\ncompelled to use such an alternative or denied access to gendered facilities for any reason. School administrators\nshould also work to de-stigmatize the use of such options, as well as to establish clear guidelines and expectations\nwith regard to respecting privacy and boundaries in changing areas and other close quarters.\nCurriculum and Training\nThe Superintendent, or designee, shall ensure that students receive age-appropriate, accurate information and\neducation related to sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. The District will integrate LGBTQ+\nhistorical and fictional figures into the curriculum and library collection in an age appropriate manner.\nIn addition, the Superintendent or designee shall designate qualified individuals to provide appropriate training and\neducational programs on the issue of harassment, discrimination, intimidation, or bullying based on sexual\norientation, gender identity, and gender expression.\nThe district will work with outside programs to be sure that they have the ability to comply with the district\u2019s\nLGBTQ+ policy and the District\u2019s standards of training and facilities prior to students attending field trips as part of\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nthe general education curriculum.\nSchool Activities and Classes\nTransgender students shall be permitted to participate in all activities in a manner consistent with their gender\nidentity.\nSchool sites shall avoid segregating students by gender (e.g. arranging seating charts by alternating boy/girl). Gender\nsegregation is a source of undue stress for transgender, non-binary, agender and gender non-conforming students.\nSegregating by gender also draws attention to the gender identity of these students, which can lead to harassment.\nGender-neutral language should be adopted (e.g. lead/follow for dance partners) to avoid stigmatizing students.\nAll school and PTO sponsored activities such as dances, sports events, field trips, etc. will not exclude students based\non gender identity. The district will work with outside programs and contractors to be sure that they have the ability\nto comply with the district\u2019s LGBTQ+ policy.\nOvernight Fieldtrips\nStudents should be assigned accommodations in a manner consistent with their gender identity. If an LGBTQ+\nstudent does not feel safe with such an arrangement, school staff shall work with the student to arrange alternative\naccommodations. \u201cPrivacy\u201d concerns from cisgender students or their parents shall not serve as justification for\nisolating transgender students or otherwise treating them differently.\nSports and Physical Education Classes\nTransgender students shall be permitted to participate in physical education classes, intramural sports, and\ncompetitive athletic activities in a manner consistent with their gender identity. This is consistent with California and\nfederal law as well as the policies established by the California Interscholastic Federation. (CIF Bylaws \u00a7 300(D)).\nCo-ed sports and physical education classes should not segregate students by gender for the formation of teams,\ndance partners, etc. Such segregation promotes sexist and heteronormative gender stereotypes in addition to being a\nsource of undue stress for transgender, non-binary, agender and gender non-conforming students.\nDress Codes/School Uniform Policies\nAll students have the right to dress in accordance with their gender identity and gender expression. School dress\ncode and uniform policies shall be gender-neutral, and shall not restrict students\u2019 clothing choices on the basis of\ngender or traditional stereotypes about what males and females \u201cshould\u201d wear.\nHarassment and Bullying\nComplaints and reports, whether made orally or in writing alleging unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory\nharassment, intimidation, retaliation or bullying based on a student\u2019s gender identity, gender expression, or gender\nnonconformity shall be addressed pursuant to the Uniform Complaint Procedures.\nThe following position is designated Compliance Officer for Nondiscrimination to handle complaints regarding\nunlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, retaliation or bullying and to answer\ninquiries regarding the district's nondiscrimination policies: (Education Code 234.1; 5 CCR 4621)",

Students should develop an appreciation for literature and for reading as a means to acquire\nknowledge. They also should develop oral and written language skills that enable them to effectively communicate\nwith others.\nThe Board desires to offer a comprehensive, balanced reading/language arts program that ensures all students have\nthe skills necessary to read fluently and for meaning. The program shall integrate reading, writing, speaking, and\nlistening activities in order to build effective communication skills.\nFor each grade level, the Board shall adopt academic standards in reading, speaking, and writing, including spelling\nand grammar, that meet or exceed state standards. The district's program also shall be aligned with the state\nframework for reading/language arts instruction.\nTeachers are encouraged to use a variety of instructional strategies to accommodate the varying needs of students.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall provide professional development opportunities that are designed to provide\ninstructional staff with knowledge about how students develop language skills, the ability to analyze students'\ndeveloping literacy, and the ability to draw from a variety of instructional strategies and materials.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district's reading/language arts program offers sufficient access\nto textbooks and other instructional materials of varying levels of difficulty, including fiction and nonfiction works, so\nthat students are continually reading at an appropriate level. In addition, technology should be available to support all\nareas of literacy.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall regularly provide the Board with data from state and district reading\nassessments and program evaluations to enable the Board to monitor program effectiveness.\nGrades K-3\nThe goal of the district's early literacy program shall be to ensure that students are able to read fluently and at grade\nlevel by the end of third grade. To reach this goal, the Superintendent or designee shall design a balanced and\ncomprehensive reading/language arts program with the following components:\n1. Explicit skill development for beginning readers that includes phonemic awareness, phonics and decoding skills,\nand sufficient practice and repetition of these skills\n \n2. A strong literature, language, and comprehension program that includes a balance of oral and written language\n \n3. Ongoing diagnosis of students' skills\n \n4. An early intervention program that provides assistance to students at risk of not meeting reading standards.\nGrades 4-8\nThe Board recognizes that reading/language arts instruction is an integral component of the curriculum at all grade\nlevels. Continuous progress in fluency and comprehension shall be the goal of reading/language arts instruction in\ngrades 4-8.\nThe program in these grades shall promote reading for subject matter comprehension, developing understanding of\nprogressively more advanced reading material, analyzing and discussing a variety of reading materials, increasing the\nfrequency of reading, developing more complex writing skills with attention to composition and vocabulary, and\ndeveloping other communications skills.\nWhen students in these grades do not have fully developed reading/language arts skills, the Superintendent or\ndesignee shall make resources available to assist them in reaching a reading level sufficient to meet the demands of\ngrade-level material. Staff at all grade levels and in every subject shall take responsibility for supporting and\nexpanding students' literacy skills.\nSupplementary Reading Instruction for Grades K-4\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nWhen state funding is available, the Board may offer students in grades K-4 increased instructional opportunities\nbefore or after school and/or outside the regular school session to assist those students who are experiencing\ndifficulty learning to read and to increase the reading skills and reading enjoyment of all students.",

Teachers should not spend class time on any topic which they\nfeel is not suitable for the class or related to the established course of study.\nThe Board also expects teachers to ensure that all sides of a controversial issue are impartially presented, with\nadequate and appropriate factual information. Without promoting any partisan point of view, the teacher should\nhelp students separate fact from opinion and warn them against drawing conclusions from insufficient data. The\nteacher shall not suppress any student's view on the issue as long as its expression is not malicious or abusive toward\nothers.\nTeachers sponsoring guest speakers shall either ask them not to use their position or influence on students to\nforward their own religious, political, economic or social views or shall take active steps to neutralize whatever bias\nhas been presented.",

Student groups also serve to\nhonor outstanding student achievement and enhance school spirit and students' sense of belonging. Prior to meeting\non school grounds, all student groups shall be authorized by the principal or designee in accordance with Board\npolicy and administrative regulation.\n(Limited Open Forum)\nThe Board encourages students to pursue interests and clubs which may not directly relate to the district's\ncurriculum and, to that end, has created a limited open forum.\nAll student-initiated groups shall be given equal access to meet on school premises during noninstructional time\nwithout regard to their religious, political, philosophical, or other speech content. The Board shall ensure that: (20\nUSC 4071, 4072)\n1. The meeting shall be voluntary and student-initiated.\n \n2. There shall be no sponsorship of the meeting by the school or staff. The term sponsorship means that school\nstaff are promoting, leading, or participating in a meeting. The assignment of a teacher, administrator, or other\nschool employee to a meeting for custodial purposes shall not constitute sponsorship of the meeting.\n \n3. Employees of the school shall be present at religious meetings only in a nonparticipatory capacity.\n \n4.

To that end, it is the\nintent of the Board of Education to enact a policy that reflects both the findings of research and reflects the wishes\nof the community of families, teachers and students.\nHomework is defined as a meaningful task assigned by the teacher in class for completion by the student outside\nschool hours. The work shall enhance the regular instructional program done in the classroom.\nThe Board believes that homework includes the following:\n1. Nightly Reading\nThe Board believes that nightly reading is important to the success of every child. Therefore, teachers should\nassign reading each night during the school week. The reading may be books of the child's own choosing or\nbooks assigned by the teacher.\nIn addition, the Board encourages children to read on the weekends, as well as vacation and summer time.\n2. Other Daily Homework\nThe District does not require teachers to give daily homework. Daily homework, if needed and required by the\nteacher, may consist of basic skills practice including such items as spelling, writing, sight words, multiplication\ntables and math facts.\n3. Long-Term Projects\nLong-term projects may take the place of, or be assigned in addition to, daily homework. Teachers will receive\nsupport in designing relevant, challenging and differentiated homework assignments that reinforce classroom\nand district learning objectives.\n4. Additional Guidelines\nThe Board expects staff to be knowledgeable about effective uses of homework. Teachers will receive support\nin designing relevant, challenging and differentiated homework assignments that reinforce classroom and\ndistrict learning objectives.\nOther than long-term projects, homework shall not be assigned on the weekends.\nTimely feedback on homework allows teachers the opportunity to assess and communicate mastery of concepts to\nstudents and parents.\nNo homework shall be required over breaks; students requesting optional homework shall receive it at the discretion\nof the teacher.\nIn accordance with the District's School Wellness Policy, students will not be given detention, study hall, or\notherwise be kept out of opportunities for physical activity, including recess on a regular basis, as the result of\nincomplete homework assignments.\nIn general, students should be able to complete homework independently.\nWhen a student sees multiple teachers during the school day, the Board expects teacher coordination with regard to\nstudent workload.\nIf a parent or guardian feels that homework is not serving their child's learning or is significantly affecting family life,\nthe Board encourages the parent to confer with the teacher. Issues falling into this realm may include, but are not\nlimited to, time spent on homework and amount or type of homework. During the meeting, the teacher and parent\nor guardian may determine whether adjustments are appropriate. If issues are not resolved with the teacher, the\nparent is encouraged to meet with the principal.\nMake up Work\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nStudents who miss schoolwork because of an excused absence shall be given the opportunity to complete all\nassignments and tests that can be reasonably provided. As determined by the teacher, the assignments and tests\nshall be reasonably equivalent to, but not necessarily identical to, the assignments and tests missed during the\nabsence. Students shall receive full credit for work satisfactorily completed within a reasonable period of time.\nWith the exception of an independent study, students who miss schoolwork because of unexcused absences shall be\ngiven the opportunity to make up missed work. Teachers shall assign such makeup work as necessary to ensure\nacademic progress; not as a punitive measure.\nSite Procedures\nThe Superintendent or designee shall ensure that each principal informs teachers and parents of the homework\npolicy and administrative regulations at least once per year at the beginning of the school year.",

      "content": "The Board of Education believes that homework should serve to enhance student learning. To that end, it is the\nintent of the Board of Education to enact a policy that reflects both the findings of research and reflects the wishes\nof the community of families, teachers and students.\nHomework is defined as a meaningful task assigned by the teacher in class for completion by the student outside\nschool hours. The work shall enhance the regular instructional program done in the classroom.\nThe Board believes that homework includes the following:\n1. Nightly Reading\nThe Board believes that nightly reading is important to the success of every child. Therefore, teachers should\nassign reading each night during the school week. The reading may be books of the child's own choosing or\nbooks assigned by the teacher.\nIn addition, the Board encourages children to read on the weekends, as well as vacation and summer time.\n \n2. Other Daily Homework\nThe District does not require teachers to give daily homework. Daily homework, if needed and required by the\nteacher, may consist of basic skills practice including such items as spelling, writing, sight words, multiplication\ntables and math facts.\nLong-Term Projects\nLong-term projects may take the place of, or be assigned in addition to, daily homework. Teachers will receive\nsupport in designing relevant, challenging and differentiated homework assignments that reinforce classroom\nand district learning objectives.\n \n3. Additional Guidelines\nThe Board expects staff to be knowledgeable about effective uses of homework. Teachers will receive support in\ndesigning relevant, challenging and differentiated homework assignments that reinforce classroom and district\nlearning objectives.\nOther than long-term projects, homework shall not be assigned on the weekends.\nTimely feedback on homework allows teachers the opportunity to assess and communicate mastery of concepts to\nstudents and parents.\nNo homework shall be required over breaks; students requesting optional homework shall receive it at the discretion\nof the teacher.\nStudents will not be given detention, study hall, or otherwise be kept out of opportunities for physical activity,\nincluding recess on a regular basis, as the result of incomplete homework assignments.\nIn general, students should be able to complete homework independently.\nWhen a student sees multiple teachers during the school day, the Board expects teacher coordination with regard to\nstudent workload.\nIf a parent or guardian feels that homework is not serving their child's learning or is significantly affecting family life,\nthe Board encourages the parent to confer with the teacher. Issues falling into this realm may include, but are not\nlimited to, time spent on homework and amount or type of homework. During the meeting, the teacher and parent\nor guardian may determine whether adjustments are appropriate. If issues are not resolved with the teacher, the\nparent is encouraged to meet with the principal.\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nMake up Work\nStudents who miss schoolwork because of an excused absence shall be given the opportunity to complete all\nassignments and tests that can be reasonably provided. As determined by the teacher, the assignments and tests\nshall be reasonably equivalent to, but not necessarily identical to, the assignments and tests missed during the\nabsence. Students shall receive full credit for work satisfactorily completed within a reasonable period of time.\nWith the exception of an independent study, students who miss schoolwork because of unexcused absences shall be\ngiven the opportunity to make up missed work. Teachers shall assign such makeup work as necessary to ensure\nacademic progress; not as a punitive measure.\nSite Procedures\nThe Superintendent or designee shall ensure that each principal informs teachers and parents of the homework\npolicy and administrative regulations at least once per year at the beginning of the school year.",

Distance learning opportunities may be offered to students\nparticipating in independent study, credit recovery courses, enrichment courses, or other courses identified by the\nSuperintendent or designee, or in the event that a school site is physically closed due to widespread illness, natural\ndisaster, or other emergency.\nThe district may offer distance teaching and learning through a variety of delivery methods as appropriate for the\ngrade level and subject matter. Distance teaching and learning opportunities shall include video, audio, and/or\nwritten instruction in which the primary mode of communication between the student and teacher is online\ninteraction, instructional television, live or prerecorded video, telecourses, and other instruction that relies on\ncomputer or communications technology.\nDistance Teaching and Learning may also include the use of print materials with written or oral feedback.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall review and select distance learning courses, which may include those taught by\ndistrict staff or others that are of high academic quality and are aligned with district standards and curricula. The\nSuperintendent or designee shall also set standards for the delivery of distance teaching and learning instruction.\nDirect teacher instruction shall be provided in conjunction with curriculum and other supports. As appropriate, and\nwith permission of a supervisor, courses may be self-directed to allow students to complete assignments at their\nown pace and/or may involve real-time interaction between the teacher and students.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall, in collaboration with teachers, plan for schoolwide or long-term distance\nlearning in the event of a school closure. In developing the plan, the Superintendent or designee shall analyze the\ncourse sequence, prioritize content and standards to be completed, and recommend the grading criteria. In such\ncircumstances, students' social-emotional wellness shall be taken into account, and schedules and learning\nexperiences shall be designed to build continuity, routine, and regular connections with students.\nAs needed, the Superintendent or designee shall provide teachers with training and ongoing support, including\ntechnological support and guidance, to effectively implement distance learning. The district shall also provide\nopportunities for teachers to communicate and collaborate with each other to exchange information on effective\npractices. The Superintendent or designee may specify additional documentation means by which teachers report on\ntheir activities implementing distance teaching and learning.\nStaff shall comply with all copyright regulations in developing materials to be used in distance education courses.\nThe district shall take steps to ensure that distance learning opportunities are available to all students, including\neconomically disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, and English learners.

All online programming and Internet content shall meet\naccessibility standards for students with disabilities, including compatibility with commonly used assistive\ntechnologies.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall assess students' access to technological devices and the Internet and,\nconsistent with the district's budget and technology plan, may loan devices to students to use at home and/or assist\nfamilies in identifying free service providers. Students are expected to use district technology responsibly in\naccordance with the district's Acceptable Use Agreement. Students and parents/guardians may not record video or\naudio or take screenshots or photographs of synchronous instruction during distance learning without written\npermission from the relevant teacher or instructor for instructional purposes. To the extent possible, the district shall\nmake technical and academic support available to students.\nTeachers shall provide regular communications to students and parents/guardians about expectations, assignments,\nand available resources to assist the student in successful completion of distance learning coursework.\nGrading of distance learning assignments and assessments of end-of-course knowledge and understanding of the\nsubject matter shall be consistent with district policy on grading for equivalent courses.",

      "content": "The Governing Board authorizes independent study as an optional alternative instructional strategy for students\nwhose needs may be best met through study outside of the regular classroom setting. Independent study shall offer\na means of individualizing the educational plan to serve students who desire a more challenging educational\nexperience, whose health or other personal circumstances make classroom attendance difficult, who are unable to\naccess course(s) due to scheduling problems, and/or who need to make up credits or fill gaps in their learning. As\nnecessary to meet student needs, independent study may be offered for short- or long-term placements, on a full-\ntime basis or on a part-time basis in conjunction with part- or full-time classroom study.\nThe Board shall hold a public hearing when considering the scope of its existing or prospective use of independent\nstudy as an instructional strategy, its purposes in authorizing independent study, and factors bearing specifically on\nthe maximum realistic lengths of assignments and acceptable number of missed assignments for specific populations\nof students or adult education students. (Education Code 51747; 5CCR 11701)\nThe Superintendent or designee may provide a variety of independent study opportunities, including, but not limited\nto, through a program or class within a comprehensive school, an alternative school or program of choice, a charter\nschool, and an online course.\nStudent participation in independent study shall be voluntary and no student shall be required to participate.\n(Education Code 51747, 51749.5, 51749.6)\nIndependent study for each student shall be under the general supervision of a district employee who possesses a\nvalid certification document pursuant to Education Code 44865 or an emergency credential pursuant to Education\nCode 44300. Students' independent study shall be coordinated, evaluated, and documented, as prescribed by law\nand reflected in the accompanying administrative regulation.

(Education\nCode 46300)\nGeneral Independent Study Requirements\nThe Superintendent or designee may continue to offer and approve independent study for an individual student\nupon determining that the student is prepared to meet the district's requirements for participation and is likely to\nsucceed as well as or better than the student would in the regular classroom setting.\nThe minimum instructional minutes shall be the same for all students at each school including students participating\nin independent study, except as otherwise permitted by law. (Education Code 46100)\nBecause excessive leniency in the duration of independent study assignments may result in a student falling behind\npeers and increase the risk of dropping out of school, independent study assignments shall be completed no more\nthan one week after assigned for all grade levels and types of programs. When necessary, based on the specific\ncircumstances of the student's approved program, the Superintendent or designee may allow for a longer period of\ntime between the date an assignment is made and when it is due, specified in the student\u2019s written agreement.\nAn evaluation shall be conducted to determine whether it is in a student's best interest to remain in independent\nstudy whenever the student fails to make satisfactory educational progress and/or misses three assignments.\nSatisfactory educational progress shall be determined based on all of the following indicators: (Education Code\n51747)\n1. The student's achievement and engagement in the independent study program, as indicated by the student's\nperformance on applicable student-level measures of student achievement and engagement specified in\nEducation Code 52060\n \n2.

(Education Code 46300, 51747)\nThe agreement shall include general student data, including the student's name, address, grade level, birth date,\nschool of enrollment, and program placement.\nThe independent study agreement for each participating student also shall include, but is not limited to, all of the\nfollowing: (Education Code 51747; 5 CCR 11700, 11702)\n1. The manner, time, frequency, place for submitting the student's assignments, reporting the student's academic\nprogress, and communicating with a student's parent/guardian regarding the student's academic progress\n \n2. The objectives and methods of study for the student's work and the methods used to evaluate that work\n \n3. The specific resources that will be made available to the student, including materials and personnel, and access\nto Internet connectivity and devices adequate to participate in the educational program and complete assigned\nwork\n \n4. A statement of the Board's policy detailing the maximum length of time allowed between an assignment and\nits completion, the level of satisfactory educational progress, and the number of missed assignments which will\ntrigger an evaluation of whether the student should be allowed to continue in independent study\n \n5. The duration of the independent study agreement, including the beginning and ending dates for the student's\nparticipation in independent study under the agreement, with a maximum of one school year\n \n6. A statement of the number of course credits or, for the elementary grades, other measures of academic\naccomplishment appropriate to the agreement, to be earned by the student upon completion\n \n7.

All such equipment shall remain the property of the district and must be able to be removed without\nremodeling or causing\ndamage to the private school. The district shall remove the equipment when no longer required by the child, when the child\nno longer attends the private school, or when removal is necessary to prevent unauthorized use.

      "content": "Referrals for Special Education Services\nThe Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district's child find process includes the collection of data and, at\nreasonable intervals, the screening of such data to determine if students are making adequate progress, as appropriate.\nA student shall be referred for special education instruction and services only after the resources of the regular education\nprogram have been considered and used where appropriate. (Education Code 56303)\nHowever, the district shall ensure that evaluations of children suspected of having a disability are not delayed or denied\nbecause of the implementation of response to intervention strategies.\nA parent/guardian or the district may initiate a request for an initial evaluation to determine if the student is a student with a\ndisability. (34 CFR 300.301)\nWhen a verbal referral is made, staff shall offer assistance to the individual to make the request in writing and shall assist the\nindividual if the individual requests such assistance. (5 CCR 3021)\nAll referrals from school staff for an initial evaluation shall include a brief reason for the referral and description of the regular\nprogram resources that were considered and/or modified for use with the student and, when appropriate, the results of\nintervention. This documentation shall not delay the timelines for completing the assessment plan or assessment. (5 CCR\n3021)\nInitial Evaluation for Special Education Services\nBefore the initial provision of special education and related services to a student with a disability, the district shall conduct a\nfull and individual initial evaluation of the student. (Education Code 56320; 34 CFR 300.301)\nUpon receipt of a referral of any student for special education and related services, a proposed evaluation plan shall be\ndeveloped within 15 calendar days, not counting days between the student's regular school sessions or terms or calendar\ndays of school vacation in excess of five school days, unless the parent/guardian agrees, in writing, to an extension. If the\nreferral is made within 10 days or less prior to the end of the student's regular school year or term, the proposed evaluation\nplan shall be developed within 10 days after the beginning of the next regular school year or term. (Education Code 56043,\n56321)\n \nThe proposed evaluation plan shall meet all of the following requirements: (Education Code 56321)\n1. Be in a language easily understood by the general public\n \n2. Be provided in the native language of the parent/guardian or other mode of communication used by the\nparent/guardian unless it is clearly not feasible\n \n3. Explain the types of evaluation to be conducted\n \n4. State that no individualized education program (IEP) will result from the evaluation without parent/guardian consent\nA copy of the notice of a parent/guardian's rights and procedural safeguards shall be attached to the evaluation plan. \n(Education Code 56321)\nThe proposed written evaluation plan shall include a description of recent assessments conducted, including available\nindependent assessments and assessment information requested by the parent/guardian to be considered, as well as\ninformation indicating the student's primary language and the student's primary language proficiency as determined by\nEducation Code section 52164.1. (5 CCR 3022)\nBefore conducting an initial evaluation, the district shall provide the parent/guardian with prior written notice in accordance\nwith 34 CFR 300.503. In addition, as part of the evaluation plan, the parent/guardian shall receive written notice that\nincludes all of the following information: (Education Code 56329; 34 CFR 300.304, 300.502, 300.504)\n1. Upon completion of the administration of tests and other evaluation materials, an IEP team meeting that includes the\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nparent/guardian or the parent/guardian's representative shall be scheduled pursuant to Education Code 56341. At this\nmeeting, the team shall determine whether or not the student is a student with disabilities, as defined in Education\nCode 56026, and shall discuss the evaluation, the educational recommendations, and the reasons for the\nrecommendations.\n \n2. When making a determination of eligibility for special education, the district shall not determine that the student is\ndisabled if the primary factor for such determination is lack of appropriate instruction in reading, including the essential\ncomponents of reading instruction as defined in 20 USC 6368, lack of appropriate instruction in mathematics, or limited\nEnglish proficiency, if the student does not otherwise meet the eligibility criteria under 34 CFR 300.8.\n \n3. A copy of the evaluation report and the documentation of determination of eligibility shall be given to the\nparent/guardian.\n \n4. If the parent/guardian disagrees with an evaluation obtained by the district, the parent/guardian has the right to obtain,\nat public expense, an independent educational evaluation (IEE) of the student from qualified specialists, in accordance\nwith 34 CFR 300.502. The parent/guardian is entitled to only one such evaluation at public expense each time the\ndistrict conducts an assessment with which the parent/guardian disagrees.\n If the district observed the student in conducting its evaluation, or if its evaluation procedures make it permissible to\nhave in-class observation of the student, an equivalent opportunity shall apply to the IEE. This equivalent opportunity\nshall apply to the student's current placement and setting as well as observation of the district's proposed placement\nand setting, if any, regardless of whether the IEE is initiated before or after the filing of a due process hearing\nproceeding.\n The district may initiate a due process hearing pursuant to Education Code 56500-56508 to show that its evaluation is\nappropriate. If the final decision resulting from the due process hearing is that the evaluation is appropriate, the\nparent/guardian maintains the right for an IEE, but not at public expense.\nIf the parent/guardian obtains an IEE at private expense, the results of the IEE shall be considered by the district with\nrespect to the provision of a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to the student, and may be presented as\nevidence at a due process hearing regarding the student. If the district observed the student in conducting its\nevaluation, or if its evaluation procedures make it permissible to have in-class observation of a student, an equivalent\nopportunity shall apply to an IEE of the student in the student's current educational placement and setting and in any\neducational placement and setting proposed by the district, regardless of whether the IEE is initiated before or after\nthe filing of a due process hearing.\nIf the parent/guardian proposes a publicly financed placement of the student in a nonpublic school, the district shall\nhave an opportunity to observe the proposed placement and, if the student has already been unilaterally placed in the\nnonpublic school by the student's parent/guardian, the student in that proposed placement. Any such observation shall\nonly be of the student who is the subject of the observation and shall not include the observation or evaluation of any\nother student in the proposed placement unless that other student's parent/guardian consents to the observation or\nevaluation. The results of any observation or evaluation of another student in violation of Education Code 56329(d)\nshall be inadmissible in any due process or judicial proceeding regarding FAPE of that other student.\nParent/Guardian Consent for Evaluations\nUpon receiving the proposed evaluation plan, the parent/guardian shall have at least 15 days to decide whether to consent to\nthe initial evaluation. The district shall not interpret parent/guardian consent for initial evaluation as consent for initial\nplacement or initial provision of special education services. (Education Code 56321; 34 CFR 300.300)\nInformed parental consent means that the parent/guardian: (Education Code 56021.1; 34 CFR 300.9)\n1. Has been fully informed, in the parent/guardian's native language or other mode of communication, of all information\nrelevant to the activity for which consent is sought\n \n2. Understands and agrees, in writing, to the carrying out of the activity for which parent/guardian consent is sought and\nthe consent describes that activity and lists the records (if any) that will be released and to whom\n \n3. Understands that the granting of consent is voluntary on the parent/guardian's part and may be revoked at any time\n \n4. Understands that if the parent/guardian revokes consent, that revocation is not retroactive (i.e., it does not negate an\naction that has occurred after the consent was given and before the consent was revoked). The district is not required\n\nto amend the education records of a student to remove any reference to the student's receipt of special education and\nservices if the student's parent/guardian submits a written revocation of consent after the initial provision of special\neducation and related services to the student.\nThe district shall make reasonable efforts to obtain the informed consent of the parent/guardian for an initial evaluation or\nreevaluation of a student. (Education Code 56321; 34 CFR 300.300, 300.322)\nThe district shall maintain a record of its attempts to obtain consent, which may include:\n1. Detailed records of telephone calls made or attempted and the results of those calls\n \n2. Copies of correspondence sent to the parent/guardian and any responses received\n \n3. Detailed records of visits made to the parent/guardian's home or place of employment and the results of those visits\nIf a parent/guardian refuses to consent to the initial evaluation or fails to respond to a request to provide consent, the district\nmay, but is not required to, pursue an evaluation by utilizing the procedural safeguards, including the mediation and due\nprocess procedures pursuant to 20 USC 1415 and 34 CFR 300.506-300.516. (Education Code 56321; 34 CFR 300.300)\nFor a student who is a ward of the state and not residing with the student's parent/guardian, the district shall make\nreasonable efforts to obtain the informed consent from the parent of the student for an initial evaluation to determine\nwhether the student is a student with a disability. The district may conduct an initial evaluation without obtaining informed\nconsent if any of the following situations exists: (Education Code 56321.1; 20 USC 1414; 34 CFR 300.300)\n1. Despite reasonable efforts to do so, the district cannot discover the whereabouts of the parent/guardian of the\nstudent.\n \n2. The rights of the parent/guardian of the student have been terminated in accordance with state law.\n \n3. The rights of the parent/guardian to make educational decisions have been subrogated by a judge in accordance with\nstate law and consent for an initial evaluation has been given by an individual appointed by the judge to represent the\nstudent.\nThe district need not obtain parent/guardian consent before reviewing existing data as part of evaluation or reevaluation, or\nbefore administering a test or other evaluation that is administered to all students, unless consent is required from the\nparents/guardians of all students. (Education Code 56321; 34 CFR 300.300)\nConduct of the Evaluation\nWithin 60 calendar days of receiving parental consent for the initial assessment of a student, not counting days between the\nstudent's regular school sessions, terms, or days of school vacation in excess of five schooldays, a determination whether the\nstudent is eligible for special education and the educational needs of the student shall be made, an IEP team meeting shall\noccur, and an IEP shall be developed, unless the parent/guardian agrees in writing to an extension, pursuant to Education\nCode 56344. If the 60-day time is interrupted by a student school vacation, the 60-day time shall recommence on the date\nthat student schooldays reconvene and a meeting to develop an IEP for the student shall be conducted within 30 days of a\ndetermination that the student needs special education and related services. (Education Code 56043, 56344)\nHowever, when a referral has been made for a student 30 days or less prior to the end of the regular school year, an IEP\nrequired as a result of an assessment of the student shall be developed within\n30 days after the commencement of the subsequent regular school year. (Education Code 56043, 56344; 34 CFR 300.301,\n300.323)\nThe evaluation shall be conducted by qualified personnel who are competent to perform the assessment as determined by\nthe district. (Education Code 56320, 56322)\nIn addition, evaluations and reevaluations shall be administered by qualified personnel who are competent in the oral or sign\nlanguage skills and written skills of the student's primary language or mode of communication and have a knowledge and\nunderstanding of the cultural and ethnic background of the student. If it is clearly not feasible to do so, an interpreter shall be\nused, and the assessment report shall document this condition and note that the validity of the assessment may have been\naffected. The normal process of second-language acquisition, as well as manifestations of dialect and sociolinguistic variance\nshall not be diagnosed as a disabling condition. (5 CCR 3023)\n\nThe screening of a student by a teacher or specialist to determine appropriate instructional strategies for curriculum\nimplementation shall not be considered to be an evaluation for eligibility for special education and related services. \n(Education Code 56321; 20 USC 1414; 34 CFR 300.302)\nIn conducting the evaluation, the district shall use a variety of assessment tools and strategies to gather relevant functional,\ndevelopmental, and academic information about the student. The district shall also use any information provided by the\nparent/guardian that may assist the district in making the determination as to whether the student is a student with a\ndisability and, if so, the necessary components of the student's IEP when the IEP is developed, including information related\nto enabling the student to be involved in and to progress in the general education curriculum. (34 CFR 300.304)\nThe district's evaluation shall not use any single measure or assessment as the sole criterion for determining whether a\nstudent is a student with a disability and for determining the appropriate educational program for the student. The\nassessment shall use technically sound instruments that may assess the relative contribution of cognitive and behavioral\nfactors in addition to physical or developmental factors. (34 CFR 300.304)\nThe district shall also ensure that assessments and other evaluation materials provide relevant information that assists in\ndetermining the student's educational needs and are: (Education Code 56320; 34 CFR 300.304)\n1. Selected and administered so as not to be discriminatory on a racial, cultural, or sexual basis\n \n2. Provided and administered in the student's native language or other mode of communication and in the form most\nlikely to yield accurate information on what the student knows and can do academically, developmentally, and\nfunctionally, unless it is clearly not feasible to so provide or administer\n \n3. Used for the purposes for which the assessments or measures are valid and reliable\n \n4. Administered by trained and knowledgeable personnel except that individually administered tests of intellectual or\nemotional functioning shall be administered by a credentialed school psychologist\n \n5. Administered in accordance with any instructions provided by the producer of the assessment\n \n6. Tailored to assess specific areas of educational need and not merely designed to provide a single general intelligence\nquotient\n \n7. If administered to a student with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills, selected and administered to best ensure\nthat the results accurately reflect the student's aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factors the test\npurports to measure, rather than reflecting the child's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (unless those skills\nare the factors that the test purports to measure).\nStudents shall be assessed in all areas related to the suspected disability, including, if appropriate, health and development,\nvision (including low vision), hearing, motor abilities, language function, general intelligence, academic performance,\ncommunicative status, self-help, orientation and mobility skills, career and vocational abilities and interests, and social and\nemotional status. When appropriate, a developmental history shall be obtained. For students with residual vision, a low\nvision assessment shall be provided in accordance with guidelines established pursuant to Education Code 56136. The\ndistrict shall ensure that the evaluation is sufficiently comprehensive to identify all of the student's special education and\nrelated service needs, whether or not commonly linked to the disability category in which the student has been classified. \n(Education Code 56320; 34 CFR 300.304)\nAs part of the initial evaluation and any reevaluation, the IEP team and other qualified professionals shall, if appropriate,\nreview existing evaluation data on the student, including evaluations and information provided by the parents/guardians,\ncurrent classroom-based local or state assessments and classroom-based observations, and observations by teachers and\nrelated services providers. On the basis of that review and input from the student's parent/guardian, the team shall identify\nwhat additional data, if any, are needed to determine: (Education Code 56381; 34 CFR 300.305)\n1. Whether the student is a student with a disability, or in the case of a reevaluation, whether the student continues to\nhave a disability, and the educational needs of the student\n \n2. The present levels of academic achievement and related developmental needs of the student\n \n3. Whether the student needs, or continues to need, special education and related services\n \n\n4. Whether any additions or modifications to the special education and related services are needed to enable the student\nto meet the measurable annual goals set out in the student's IEP and to participate, as appropriate, in the general\neducation curriculum\nIf a student has transferred from another district in the same school year or leaves this district, the district shall coordinate\nwith the student's prior or subsequent district as necessary and as expeditiously as possible to ensure prompt completion of\nfull evaluations. (34 CFR 300.304)\nEvaluation Report\nThe personnel who evaluate the student shall prepare a written report of the results of each evaluation. The report shall\ninclude, but not be limited to, the following: (Education Code 56327)\n1. Whether the student may need special education and related services\n \n2. The basis for making the determination\n \n3. The relevant behavior noted during the observation of the student in an appropriate setting\n \n4. The relationship of that behavior to the student's academic and social functioning\n \n5. The educationally relevant health, developmental, and medical findings, if any\n \n6. For students with learning disabilities, whether there is such a discrepancy between achievement and ability that it\ncannot be corrected without special education and related services\n \n7. A determination concerning the effects of environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage, where appropriate\n \n8. The need for specialized services, materials, and equipment for students with low incidence disabilities, consistent with\nEducation Code 5613\nEligibility Determination\nUpon completion of the administration of assessments and other evaluation measures, a group of qualified professionals and\nthe parent/guardian shall determine whether the student is a student with a disability as defined in 5 CCR 3030 and 34 CFR\n300.8 and, if so, the student's educational needs. In interpreting the data, the group shall draw information from a variety of\nsources, including aptitude and achievement tests, parent/guardian input, and teacher recommendations, as well as\ninformation about the student's physical condition, social or cultural background, and adaptive behavior. The group shall\nensure that the information obtained from these sources is documented and carefully considered. (34 CFR 300.306)\nWhen making a determination of eligibility for special education and related services, the district shall not determine that a\nstudent is disabled if the primary factor for such determination is a lack of appropriate instruction in reading, including the\nessential components of reading instruction pursuant to 20 USC 6368, lack of instruction in mathematics, limited English\nproficiency, or that the student does not otherwise meet the eligibility criteria. (Education Code 56329; 34 CFR 300.306)\nThe normal process of second-language acquisition, as well as manifestations of dialect and sociolinguistic variance, shall not\nbe diagnosed as a disabling condition. (5 CCR 3023)\nIndependent Educational Evaluation\nAn independent educational evaluation is defined as an evaluation conducted by a qualified examiner who is not employed by\nthe district. (34 CFR 300.502)\nPublic expense means that the district either pays for the full cost of the IEE or ensures that the evaluation is otherwise\nprovided at no cost to the parent/guardian. (34 CFR 300.502)\nThe parents/guardians of a student with a disability have the right to obtain an IEE at public expense under the same criteria,\nincluding the location of the evaluation and the qualifications of the examiner, that the district uses for a district-initiated\nevaluation. (34 CFR 300.502)\nThe parent/guardian is entitled to only one IEE at public expense each time the district conducts an evaluation with which the\nparent/guardian disagrees. (Education Code 56329; 34 CFR 300.502)\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nIf a parent/guardian has requested an IEE, the district may ask for the reason that the parent/guardian objects to the district's\nevaluation. However, the parent/guardian is not required to provide an explanation and the district may not unreasonably\ndelay either providing the IEE at public expense or filing a due process complaint to request a due process hearing to defend\nthe public evaluation. (34 CFR 300.502)\nUpon receiving the request for an IEE, the district shall, without unnecessary delay, either: (34 CFR 300.502)\n1. File a due process complaint to request a hearing to show that its evaluation is appropriate\n \n2. Ensure that an IEE is provided at public expense, unless the district demonstrates at a hearing that the evaluation\nobtained by the parent/guardian did not satisfy the district's criteria\nIf a due process hearing decision determines that the district's evaluation is appropriate, then the parent/guardian may obtain\nan IEE but not at public expense. (Education Code 56329; 34 CFR 300.502)\nIn any decision made with respect to providing FAPE to a student with a disability, the result of any IEE obtained by the\nstudent's parent/guardian shall be considered by the district if it meets district criteria. Any such result also may be presented\nas evidence at a hearing on a due process complaint. (Education Code 56329; 34 CFR 300.502)\nReevaluation\nA reevaluation shall be conducted when the district determines that the educational or related service needs of the student,\nincluding improved academic achievement and functional performance, warrant a reevaluation or if the student's\nparent/guardian or teacher requests reevaluation. Such reevaluations shall occur every three years, unless the\nparent/guardian\nand district agree in writing that a reevaluation is unnecessary. A reevaluation may not occur more than once a year, unless\nthe parent/guardian and the district agree otherwise. (Education Code 56043, 56381; 34 CFR 300.303)\nThe district shall ensure that any reevaluations of the student are conducted in accordance with the evaluation procedures\npursuant to 34 CFR 300.304-300.311. (34 CFR 300.303)\nBefore entering kindergarten or first grade, as the case may be, children with disabilities who are in a preschool program shall\nbe reevaluated to determine if they still need special education and services. IEP teams shall identify a means of monitoring\nthe continued success of children who are determined to be eligible for less intensive special education programs. (Education\nCode 56445)",

      "content": "The Governing Board recognizes that an extended break from the instructional program may result in significant \nlearning loss, especially among disadvantaged and low-achieving students, and desires to provide opportunities for \nstudents to practice essential skills, make academic progress, and develop social, emotional, and physical needs and \ninterests through hands-on engaging learning experiences.\nSummer programs offered by the district shall be aligned with the district's local control and accountability plan \n(LCAP), other applicable district and school plans, and the educational program provided during the school year. When \nfeasible, summer programs shall blend high-quality academic instruction in core curricular and/or elective subjects with \nrecreation, nutrition programs, social and emotional development, and support services that encourage attendance, \nstudent engagement in learning, and student wellness.\nSummer School:\nThe Superintendent or designee shall establish summer school classes pursuant to Education Code 46120. \nThe district's summer school program may be used to provide supplemental instruction to students needing remediation \nand/or enrichment in core academic subjects.\n1. \n \nDemonstrate academic deficiencies in core curriculum areas\n \n2. \n \nAre in targeted student groups identified in the district's LCAP as needing increased or improved services to \nsucceed in the educational program\n \n3. \n \nAre in grades transitional kindergarten (TK)-6 and are required to be offered or provided access to Expanded \nLearning Opportunities Programs pursuant to Education Code 46120 and BP/AR 5184.2 - Before/After School \nPrograms\n \nThe remaining openings shall be offered to other district students on a first-come first-served basis. \nAttendance:\nBecause summer courses cover extensive instructional content in a relatively short time period, students who have more \nthan three excused absences or one unexcused absence may not receive credit for their summer session class(es) unless \nthey make-up missed work in accordance with law, Board policy, and administrative regulation.\nRotation of School Sites:\nSites for summer school programs may be rotated in an effort to make summer school programs more accessible to all \nstudents, regardless of residence or regular attendance area, and accommodate the maintenance needs of district \nschools.\nThe Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the Board on summer school enrollment in the current year and \nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nprevious year for the program as a whole and disaggregated by grade level, school that the students attend during the \nregular school year, and student population. In addition, the Superintendent or designee may report on the extent to \nwhich students successfully achieved the outcomes established for the program.\nAdditional Summer Learning Opportunities:\nDistricts are prohibited from charging a fee for summer school programs. However, it is permissible for third parties \nthat offer a summer school program to charge a fee for such program. CDE's, \"Fiscal Management Advisory 22-01, \nSummer School, Third Parties, and Tuition Fees,\" provides that if a third party that is affiliated with a district charges \ntuition for a summer program, the district should make an individualized inquiry as to the relationship between the \ndistrict and the third party to determine whether the educational activities are being offered by the district. In making \nthis determination, districts may consider factors listed in Fiscal Management Advisory 22-01. Districts with questions \nas to whether a fee may be charged for summer school should consult CSBA's District and County Office of Education \nLegal Services or district legal counsel. See also BP/AR 3260 - Fees and Charges\nThe Superintendent or designee may collaborate with parents/guardians, city and county agencies, community \norganizations, child care providers, and/or other interested persons to develop, implement, and build awareness of \norganized activities that support summer learning.\nStrategies to support summer learning may include, but are not limited to: \n1. \n \nProviding information to students and parents/guardians about summer reading programs scheduled to be \nconducted by public libraries or community organizations \n \n2. \n \nCollaborating with the local parks and recreation agency and/or community organizations to provide day camps, \nsports programs, or other opportunities for physical education and activity \n \n3. \n \nEncouraging reading in the home, such as providing lists of recommended reading to students and \nparents/guardians, establishing a target number of books or pages, and providing prizes for achievement of \nreading goals \n \n4. \n \nAssigning summer vacation homework in core curricular subject(s) for extra credit \n \n \n5.

Reasonable equivalency shall be determined based on a comparison group of district schools\nwith similar grade levels, the capacity of facilities, and the condition of facilities, as described below in the section\n\"Submission and Review of Facilities Requests.\" (5 CCR 11969.2, 11969.3)\nFurnished and equipped means the facilities include reasonably equivalent furnishing necessary to conduct classroom\ninstruction and to provide for student services that directly support classroom instruction as found in the comparison\ngroup schools established under 5 CCR 11969.3(a) and that the facilities have equipment that is reasonably\nequivalent to the comparison group schools. Equipment means property that does not lose its identity when\nremoved from its location and is not changed materially or consumed immediately (e.g., within one year). Equipment\nhas relatively permanent value and its purchase increases the total value of the district's physical properties.\nExamples include furniture, vehicles, machinery, motion picture film, videotape, furnishings that are not an integral\npart of the building or building system, and certain intangible assets such as major software programs. Furnishings\nand equipment acquired for a school site with nondistrict resources are excluded when determining reasonable\nequivalence. (5 CCR 11969.2)\nContiguous facilities are those facilities contained on a school site or immediately adjacent to a school site. If the in-\ndistrict classroom ADA of the charter school cannot be accommodated on any single school site, contiguous facilities\nalso include facilities located at more than one site, provided that the district minimizes the number of sites assigned\nand considers student safety. If none of the district-operated schools has grade levels similar to the charter school,\nthen a contiguous facility shall be an existing facility that is most consistent with the needs of students in the grade\nlevels served at the charter school. (5 CCR 11969.2, 11969.3)\nConversion charter school is a charter school established through the conversion of an existing public school.\n(Education Code 47605)\nEligibility for District Facilities\nA charter school shall be operating in the district, as defined above, before it submits a request for facilities. A new or\nproposed charter school operating in the district is eligible to request facilities for a particular fiscal year only if it\nsubmits its charter petition before November 1 of the fiscal year preceding the year for which facilities are\nrequested. A new charter school is entitled to be allocated and/or provided access to facilities only if it receives\napproval of its charter petition before March 15 of the fiscal year preceding the year for which facilities are\nrequested. (5 CCR 11969.9)\nSubmission and Review of Facilities Requests\nThe following procedures shall apply to a charter school's request for facilities:\n1. On or before November 1, a charter school shall submit a written request for facilities to the Superintendent or\ndesignee for the next fiscal year. The request shall include: (Education Code 47614; 5 CCR 11969.2, 11969.9)\n \nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\na. Reasonable projections of in-district and total ADA and in-district and total classroom ADA, based on\nADA claimed for apportionment, if any, in the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the facilities\nrequest is made, adjusted for expected changes in enrollment in the forthcoming fiscal year\nProjections of in-district ADA, in-district classroom ADA, and the number of in-district students shall be\nbroken down by grade level and by the district school that the students would otherwise attend.\nNonclassroom ADA may be included in the ADA calculation only to the extent of instructional time that\nstudents generating nonclassroom ADA are actually in the classroom under the direct supervision and\ncontrol of a charter school employee, and only if the district and the charter school agree upon the\ntime(s) that the facilities devoted to students generating nonclassroom-based ADA will be used.\n \nb. A description of the methodology for the projections\n \nc. If relevant (i.e., when a charter school is not yet open or to the extent an operating charter school\nprojects a substantial increase in ADA), documentation of the number of in-district students meaningfully\ninterested in attending the charter school that is sufficient for the district to determine the\nreasonableness of the projection, but that need not be verifiable for precise arithmetical accuracy\n \nd. The charter school's operational calendar\n \ne. Information regarding the district's school site and/or general geographic area in which the charter\nschool wishes to locate\n \nf. Information on the charter school's educational program that is relevant to assignment of facilities, if any\nIn submitting a facilities request, the charter school shall use a form specified by the district. The charter\nschool shall distribute a reasonable number of copies of the written request to parents/guardians, school\nstaff, and/or other interested parties, or shall otherwise make the request available for review.\n \n2. On or before December 1, the district shall review the charter school's projections of in-district and total ADA\nand in-district and total classroom ADA, express any objections in writing, and state the projections the district\nconsiders reasonable. If the district does not express any objections in writing and state its own projections by\nthe deadline, the charter school's projections are no longer subject to challenge and the district shall base its\noffer of facilities on those projections. (5 CCR 11969.9)\n \n3. On or before January 2, the charter school shall respond to any objections expressed by the district and to the\ndistrict's attendance projections provided pursuant to item #2 above. The charter school shall reaffirm or\nmodify its previous projections as necessary to respond to the information received from the district pursuant\nto item #2. If the charter school does not respond by January 2, the district's projections provided pursuant to\nitem #2 are no longer subject to challenge and the district shall base its offer of facilities on those projections.\n(5 CCR 11969.9)\n \n4. The district shall determine what facilities it will offer to the charter school, ensuring that the facilities are\nreasonably equivalent to other district facilities. (5 CCR 11969.3)\nIf a charter school was established through the conversion of an existing public school pursuant to Education\nCode 47605(a)(2), the condition of the facility previously used by the district shall be considered to be\nreasonably equivalent for the first year the charter school uses the facility. (5 CCR 11969.3)\nFor any other charter school, reasonable equivalency shall be based on the following criteria as detailed in 5\nCCR 11969.3: (5 CCR 11969.3)\n \na. A comparison group of district schools with similar grade levels\nIf a charter school's grade-level configuration is different from the configuration of the district's schools,\nthe district shall not pay for the modification of a school site to accommodate the charter school's\nconfiguration.\n \nb. Capacity, including equivalency of the ratio of teaching stations (classrooms), specialized classroom\nspace, and nonteaching space to ADA\n\nc. Condition of facilities, as determined by assessing such factors as age of facilities (from last\nmodernization), quality of materials, and state of maintenance, including:\n \ni. School site size\n \nii. Condition of interior and exterior surfaces\n \niii. Condition of mechanical, plumbing, electrical, and fire alarm systems, including conformity to\napplicable codes\n \niv. Availability and condition of technology infrastructure\n \nv. Condition of the facility as a safe learning environment, including, but not limited to, the suitability\nof lighting, noise mitigation, and size for intended use\n \nvi. Condition of the facility's furnishing and equipment\n \nvii. Condition of athletic fields and/or play area space\n5. On or before February 1, the district shall prepare a written preliminary proposal regarding the space to be\nallocated to the charter school and/or to which the charter school is to be provided access. In evaluating and\naccommodating the charter school's request, the charter school's in-district students shall be given the same\nconsideration as students in the district's schools, subject to the requirement that the facilities provided must\nbe contiguous. At a minimum, the preliminary proposal shall include: (5 CCR 11969.2, 11969.3, 11969.9)\n \na. The projections of in-district classroom ADA on which the proposal is based\n \nb. The specific location(s) of the space\n \nc. All conditions pertaining to the space, including a draft of any proposed agreement pertaining to the\ncharter school's use of the space\n \nd. The projected pro rata share amount and a description of the methodology used to determine that\namount\n \ne. A list and description of the comparison group schools used in developing the district's preliminary\nproposal and a description of the difference between the preliminary proposal and the charter school's\nrequest submitted pursuant to item #1 above\n \n6. On or before March 1, the charter school shall respond in writing to the district's preliminary proposal made\npursuant to item #5 above and shall express any concerns, including differences between the preliminary\nproposal and the charter school's request, and/or make a counter proposal. (5 CCR 11969.9)\n \n7. On or before April 1, having reviewed any concerns and/or counter proposals made by the charter school\npursuant to item #6 above, the district shall submit, in writing, a final notification of the space to be offered to\nthe charter school. The notification shall include a response to the charter school's concerns and/or counter\nproposal, if any. The final notification shall specifically identify: (5 CCR 11969.9)\na. The teaching stations, specialized classroom spaces, and nonteaching station spaces offered for the\nexclusive use of the charter school and the teaching stations, specialized classroom spaces, and\nnonteaching spaces to which the charter school is to be provided access on a shared basis with district-\noperated programs\n \nb.

      "content": "The Redwood City School District (RCSD) Board of Education recognizes that the official name selected for any\ndistrict facility, school or any part of a school such as classrooms, libraries, offices, band rooms, stadiums, etc., is a\nvital factor in the public image of the school. Therefore, the first consideration of the Board of Education in name\nselections shall be the honor and integrity that the name will reflect upon the school.\nThe following guidelines shall control the selection of names for schools and other district-owned or leased buildings,\ngrounds, and facilities. No facility shall be named after a current, full-time or part-time employee.\nNaming Schools\nThe Board encourages community participation in the process of selecting names. The principal shall appoint two\nparents, two local school representatives, and two independent local residents to form a citizen advisory committee.\nThis committee will be charged with the task of receiving and screening name suggestions and developing a list of\nrecommended names to submit to the Superintendent. The Board members and Superintendent will be provided\nwith the full list of suggestions.\nThe committee will give consideration to:\n1. Deceased individuals who have made a significant social contribution at the local, state or national level. If an\nindividual name is proposed, only the last name will symbolize the official name.\n \n2. Names of communities or geographic locations served by the school, including roads and landmarks.\n \n3. Other meaningful names reflecting the school's vision and mission.\nSince naming a facility is an important community matter, citizens advisory committee may solicit ideas from the\ngeneral community, parents/guardians, and students of the facility, and district employees (including administrators\nand teachers).\nThe committee will choose two or three names to be submitted to the Superintendent. The Superintendent will then\nmake a recommendation to the Board of Education. The Board of Education should approve the name by a majority\nvote.\nAny name adopted for any new school shall not be so similar to the name of any existing district school as to result in\nconfusion to members of the community.\nBefore adopting any proposed name, the Board shall hold a public hearing at which members of the public will be\ngiven an opportunity to provide input.\nNaming Local School Facilities\nWhen the naming of a local school facility (stadium, field, library, e.g.) is proposed at the local school level, the\nfollowing process will be followed:\n1. The principal shall recommend the name to the school's School Site Council.\n \n2. The School Site Council shall recommend the name to the Superintendent.\n \n3. The Superintendent shall recommend the name to the Board of Education.\n \n4. The Board of Education shall approve the name by a majority vote.\nThe committee will give consideration to deceased individuals who have made a significant social contribution. If an\nindividual name is proposed, only the last name will symbolize the official name. Names of communities or\ngeographic locations served by the school, including roads and landmarks shall also be considered, as well as other\nmeaningful names reflecting the school's vision and mission.\nRenaming Facilities\nBoard Policy Manual\nRedwood City School District\n\nPolicy Reference Disclaimer:\nIn the event a facility is no longer used as a school, the following process will be followed:\n1. A committee with a minimum of three administrative staff shall be appointed by the Superintendent and\ncharged with the task of developing a list of recommended names for the facility.\n \n2. The recommended names shall be submitted to the Superintendent.\n \n3. The Superintendent will then make a recommendation to the Board of Education.\n \n4. The Board of Education shall approve the name by a majority vote.\nConsideration should be given to names related to the function or specialty of the particular facility and/or\nindividuals who have made a significant social contribution.\nIf an individual name is proposed, only the last name will symbolize the official name. Names of communities or\ngeographic locations served by the school, including roads and landmarks shall also be considered.\nIn the event a school or program is moved to a different facility, the following process will be followed:\nThe Superintendent can recommend to the Board of Education that the school keep the same name at its new\nfacility.\nThe Board of Education shall approve the name by a majority vote.\nAny name adopted for any new school shall not be so similar to the name of any existing district school as to result in\nconfusion to members of the community.\nBefore adopting any proposed name, the Board shall hold a public hearing at which members of the public will be\ngiven an opportunity to provide input.\nMemorials\nUpon request, the Board of Education shall consider planting commemorative trees, erecting monuments, or\ndedicating buildings, parts of buildings, athletic fields, gardens, or other district facilities, in memory of deceased\nstudents, staff members, community members, and benefactors of the district.\nNaming Rights\nThe Board of Education may grant to any person or entity the right to name any district facility. In doing so, the\nBoard of Education shall enter into a written agreement that shall:\n1. Specify the benefits to the district from entering into the agreement.\n \n2. State the roles and responsibilities of the parties to the agreement, including whether or not the Board of\nEducation shall retain the power to approve any proposed name.\n \n3. Provide details related to the naming right granted, including the building, grounds, or facility involved and the\nduration for which the name shall be in effect.\n \n4. Prohibit any message, image, or other depiction that advocates or endorses the use of drugs, tobacco, or\nalcohol, encourages unlawful discrimination against any person or group, or promotes the use of violence or\nthe violation of any law or district policy.\n \n5. Reserve the authority to terminate the naming right if it determines that the grantee, subsequent to receiving\nthe naming right, has engaged in any of the prohibited acts stated in item #4 above or other criminal or\nunlawful acts that might bring the district into disrepute.",
