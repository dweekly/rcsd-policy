Code 35107) Any person who has been convicted of a felony involving the giving,\naccepting, or offering of a bribe, embezzlement or theft of public funds, extortion, perjury, or conspiracy to commit any such\ncrime, under California law or the law of another state, the United States of America, or another country, is not eligible to be\na candidate for office or elected as a Governing Board member except when the person has been granted a pardon in\naccordance with law. (Education Code 35107; Elections Code 20)\nA district employee elected to the Governing Board shall resign from district employment before being sworn in or shall have\nthe employment automatically terminated upon being sworn into office. (Education Code 35107)\nThe Governing Board encourages all candidates to become knowledgeable about the role of Governing Board members. The\nSuperintendent or designee shall provide all candidates with information that will enable them to understand the\nresponsibilities and expectations of being a Governing Board member, including information regarding available workshops,\nseminars, and/or training. The Superintendent or designee shall provide all candidates with the county election official's\ncontact information and general information about school programs, district operations, and Governing Board responsibilities.\nRecalling a Governing Board Member \nA Governing Board member may be recalled as permitted by Elections Code 11000. Proponents of a recall are required to\nserve, file, and publish or post a notice of intention to circulate the recall petition and to comply with other applicable law and\nformalities and county elections official directives. The petition, pursuant to Elections Code 11041, is required to be in the\nformat provided by the Secretary of State and to include an estimate of the cost of conducting the special election, as\ndetermined by the county elections official, in consultation with the district.\nWithin 14 days after the meeting at which the Governing Board receives a certificate of sufficiency of signatures on a recall\npetition from the county elections official, the Governing Board shall order an election to be held to determine whether the\nGoverning Board member named in the petition shall be recalled. The election shall be held not less than 88, nor more than\n125, days after the date that the Governing Board orders the election. However, the election may be conducted within 180\ndays after the issuance of the Governing Board's order to consolidate the election with a regularly scheduled election.\nRecall elections shall be conducted in accordance with Elections Code 11381-11386.\nConsolidation of Elections\nTo reduce costs associated with conducting elections, the Governing Board may consolidate Governing Board elections with\nthe local municipal or statewide primary or general election. Governing Board election procedures shall be conducted in\naccordance with Elections Code 1302.\nIn addition, if a regularly scheduled Governing Board election held other than on a statewide election date results in a\ndecrease in local voter turnout of 25 percent or more compared to the average local turnout for the previous four statewide\ngeneral elections, the Governing Board shall take action to consolidate Governing Board elections with statewide elections.\n(Elections Code 14051, 14052)\nIn order to consolidate elections based on either circumstance described above, the Governing Board shall adopt a resolution\nand submit it to the County Board of Supervisors for approval not later than 240 days prior to the date of the currently\nscheduled district election. (Elections Code 10404.5)\nWhenever a regularly scheduled Governing Board election is changed due to consolidation of elections, the terms of office of\nincumbent Governing Board members shall be extended to align with the next applicable election. (Elections Code 10404.5)\nElections Process and Procedures\nThe district is divided into trustee areas and each trustee area shall be represented by a Governing Board member who\nresides in and is elected by voters residing within that trustee area. Trustee areas shall be balanced by population as required\nby state and federal law. Prior to March 1 following the year in which the results of each decennial federal census are\nreleased, the Governing Board shall adjust the boundaries of the district's trustee areas based on population figures as\nvalidated by the Population Research Unit of the Department of Finance. (Education Code 5019.5)\nTo ensure ongoing compliance with the California Voting Rights Acts, the Governing Board may review the district's\n\n\nGoverning Board election method to determine whether any modification is necessary due to changes in the district's\npopulation or any of its racial, color, or language minority group composition. The review shall be based on the\nSuperintendent or designee's report to the Governing Board after the release of each decennial federal census.\nWhen the district's election method is to be changed, the Governing Board determines that a change is necessary, it shall hold\npublic hearings in accordance with Elections Code 10100 before adopting a resolution at an open meeting specifying the\nchange(s), and shall, in accordance with Education Code 5019, obtain approval from the county committee on school district\norganization having jurisdiction over the district.\nThe election method or trustee-area boundaries in effect at the beginning of a Governing Board member's term shall be used\nwhen any vacancy that occurs during that term is to be filled, even if, during the term, the district has adopted \u201cby-trustee\narea\u201d election method or trustee area boundaries have been adjusted.\nAny petition for a special election ordered pursuant to Education Code 5091 shall contain the county election official's\nestimate of the cost of conducting the special election, expressed on a per-student basis. (Education Code 5091)\nCampaign Conduct\nAll candidates, including current Governing Board members running as incumbents, shall abide by local, county, state, and\nfederal requirements regarding campaign donations, funding, and expenditures.\nA Governing Board member shall not expend, and a candidate shall not accept, any public money for the purpose of seeking\nelective office. However, the district may establish a dedicated fund for those seeking election to the Governing Board,\nprovided that the funds are available to all candidates who are qualified pursuant to Education Code 35107 without regard to\nincumbency or political preference. (Government Code 85300)\nIn order to help protect the public's trust in the electoral process as well as the public's confidence in the Governing Board\nand district, the Governing Board encourages all candidates to sign and adhere to the principles in the Code of Fair Campaign\nPractices pursuant to Elections Code 20440.\nStatement of Qualifications\nOn the 125th day prior to the day fixed for the general district election, the Governing Board secretary or their designee shall\ndeliver a notice, bearing the secretary's signature and district seal, to the county elections official describing both of the\nfollowing: (Elections Code 10509)\n1. The elective offices of the district to be filled at the general election and which offices, if any, are for the balance of an\nunexpired term\n2. Whether the district or the candidate is to pay for the publication of a statement of qualifications pursuant to Elections\nCode 13307\nCandidates for the Governing Board may submit a candidate statement to the elections official for inclusion in the voter\u2019s\npamphlet. Candidate statements shall be limited to no more than 200 words. (Elections Code 13307)\nWhen the elections official allows for the electronic distribution of candidate statements, a candidate for the Governing\nBoard may, in addition to or instead of submitting a candidate statement for inclusion in the mailed voter's pamphlet, prepare\nand submit a candidate statement for electronic distribution.\nThe district shall assume no part of the cost of printing, handling, translating, mailing, or electronically distributing candidate\nstatements filed pursuant to Elections Code 13307. As a condition of having candidate statements included in the hard copy\nand/or electronic voter's pamphlet, the district may require candidates to pay their estimated pro rata share of these costs to\nthe district in advance pursuant to Elections Code 13307.\nTie Votes in Board Member Elections\nWhenever a tie makes it impossible to determine which of two or more candidates has been elected to the Governing Board,\nthe Governing Board shall immediately notify the candidates who received the tie votes of the time and place where the\ncandidates or their representatives should appear before the Governing Board. The Governing Board at that time shall\ndetermine the winner by lot. (Education Code 5016) \n\nLegal Reference:",

(Government Code 87303)\nUpon direction by the code reviewing body, the Board shall review the district's conflict of interest code and submit\nany changes to the code reviewing body or, if no change is required, the district shall submit a written statement to\nthat effect to the code reviewing body. If a change in the code is necessitated by changed circumstances, such as\nthe creation of new designated positions, amendments or revisions, the amended code shall be submitted to the\ncode reviewing body within 90 days after the changed circumstances necessitating the amendments have become\napparent.

If a Board member has such a financial interest in a\ncontract made by the Board, the contract is void. (Government Code 1090)\nA Board member shall not be considered to be financially interested in a contract in which they have only a \"remote\ninterest,\" as specified in Government Code 1091, if the interest is disclosed during a Board meeting and noted in the\nofficial Board minutes. The affected Board member shall not vote or debate on the matter or attempt to influence\nany other Board member or district official to enter into the contract. (Government Code 1091)\nIn addition, a Board member shall not be considered to be financially interested in a contract in which their interest is\na \"noninterest\" as defined in Government Code 1091.5.

      "content": "The Board of Education shall adopt written policies to convey its expectations for actions that will be taken in the\ndistrict, clarify roles and responsibilities of the Board and Superintendent, and communicate Board philosophy and\npositions to the students, staff, parents/guardians and the community. Board policies are binding on the district to\nthe extent that they do not conflict with federal or state law and are consistent with the district's collective\nbargaining agreements.\nThe Board recognizes the importance of maintaining a policy manual that is up to date and reflects the mandates of\nlaw. Policies shall be regularly reviewed at a time allocated for this purpose on the agenda of public Board meetings.\nThe Board shall review certain policies annually, as required by Education Code 35160.5. If no revisions are deemed\nnecessary, the Board minutes shall nevertheless indicate that the review was conducted. Other policies shall be\nmonitored and reviewed as specified in the policy itself or as needed to reflect changes in law or district\ncircumstances.\nPolicy Development and Adoption Process\nThe district's policy development process shall include the following basic steps:\n1. The Board and/or Superintendent or designee shall identify the need for a new policy or revision of an existing\npolicy. The need may arise from a change in law, a new district vision or goals, educational research or trends,\nor a change in the superintendency or Board membership. The need may also occur as a result of an incident\nthat has arisen in the district or a recommendation or request from staff or other interested persons.\n \n2. As needed, the Superintendent or designee shall gather fiscal and other data, staff and public input, related\ndistrict policies, sample policies from other organizations or agencies, and other useful information to fully\ninform the Board Policy Committee about the issue.\n \n3. The Board Policy Committee may consider how the proposed policy may affect student learning, community\nexpectations, staff recommendations, fiscal impact, as well as the policy's impact on governance and\noperational efficiency.\n \n4. The Board or Superintendent may request that legal counsel review the draft policy as appropriate.\n \n5. The Superintendent or designee, along with the Board Policy Committee shall develop and present a draft\npolicy for a first reading at a public Board meeting. At its second reading, the Board may take action on the\nproposed policy. The Board may waive the second reading or may require an additional reading if necessary.\nOnly policies formally adopted by a majority vote of the Board shall constitute official Board policy.\nThe district's policy development process may be revised or expanded as needed based on the issue being\nconsidered, the need for more information, or to provide greater opportunities for consultation and public input.\nPolicies shall become effective upon Board adoption or at a future date designated by the Board at the time of\nadoption.\nBoard Bylaws\nThe Board shall prescribe and enforce rules for its own government consistent with state law and regulations.\n(Education Code 35010)\nBylaws governing Board operations may be developed, adopted, and amended following the same procedures as\nthose used for the adoption or amendment of Board policy.\nAdministrative Regulations\nThe Superintendent or designee shall be responsible for developing and enforcing administrative regulations for the\noperation of the district. Administrative regulations shall be consistent with law and Board policy and shall be\ndesigned to promote the achievement of district goals and objectives. Administrative regulations may describe\nspecific actions to be taken, roles and responsibilities of staff, timelines, and/or other necessary provisions. The\n\n\n\nSuperintendent or designee also may develop procedures manuals, handbooks, or other guides to carry out the\nintent of Board policy.\nWhen Board policies are amended, the Superintendent or designee shall review corresponding regulations to ensure\nthat they conform to the intent of the revised policy. In case of conflict between administrative regulation and Board\npolicy, policy shall prevail.\nThe Board may review and/or approve regulations for the purpose of ensuring conformity with the intent of Board\npolicy.\nMonitoring and Evaluation\nAt the time a policy is adopted, the Board and Superintendent or designee shall determine whether an evaluation of\nthe policy should be scheduled and, if so, shall agree upon a timeline and measures for evaluating the effectiveness\nof the policy in achieving its purpose.\nAccess to Policies\nThe Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all district employees and the public have access to an up-to-date\ndistrict policy manual. A public copy of the policy manual shall be maintained at the district central office and at each\nschool site. These copies shall be maintained either electronically or by paper copy.\nAs necessary, the Superintendent or designee shall notify staff, parents/guardians, students, and other stakeholders\nwhenever a policy that affects them is adopted or revised. He/she may determine the appropriate communications\nstrategy depending on the issue.\nSuspension of Policies\nNo Board policy, bylaw, or administrative regulation, or any portion thereof, shall be operative if it is found to be in\nconflict with applicable federal or state law or regulations or court decisions. If any portion of a policy is found to be\ninvalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions of the policy.",

      "content": "Agenda Content\nGoverning Board meeting agendas shall reflect the district's vision and goals and the Board's focus on\nstudent learning and well-being. Each agenda shall state the meeting time and location and shall briefly\ndescribe each item to be transacted or discussed, including items to be discussed in closed session. \n(Government Code 54954.2)\nThe agenda shall provide members of the public the opportunity to address the Board on any agenda item\nbefore or during the Board's consideration of the item. However, the agenda need not provide an\nopportunity for public comment when the agenda item has previously been considered at an open meeting\nby a committee comprised exclusively of Board members, provided that members of the public were\nafforded an opportunity to comment on the item, before or during the committee's consideration of the item,\nand the item has not been substantially changed since the committee considered it. (Government Code\n54954.3)\nThe agenda for a regular Board meeting shall also provide members of the public an opportunity to provide\ncomment on matters which are not on the agenda but which are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the\nBoard. (Education Code 35145.5; Government Code 54954.3)\nEach agenda for a regular meeting shall list the address designated by the Superintendent or designee for\npublic inspection of documents related to an open session item that have been distributed to the Board less\nthan 72 hours before the meeting. (Government Code 54957.5)\nThe agenda shall include information regarding how, when, and to whom a request for disability-related\naccommodations or modifications, including auxiliary aids and services, may be made by an individual who\nrequires accommodations or modifications in order to participate in the Board meeting. (Government Code\n54954.2)\nAgenda Preparation\nThe Board president and the Superintendent, as secretary to the Board, shall work together to develop the\nagenda for each regular and special meeting. Each agenda shall reflect the district's vision and goals and the\nBoard's focus on student learning.\nAny Board member or member of the public may request that a matter within the jurisdiction of the Board\nbe placed on the agenda of a regular meeting. The request shall be submitted in writing to the\nSuperintendent or designee with supporting documents and information, if any, at least ten days before the\nscheduled meeting date. Items submitted less than ten days before the scheduled meeting date may be\npostponed to a later meeting in order to allow sufficient time for consideration and research of the issue.\nThe Board president and Superintendent shall decide whether a request from a member of the public is\nwithin the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board. Items not within the subject matter jurisdiction of the\nBoard may not be placed on the agenda. In addition, before placing the item on the agenda, the Board\npresident and Superintendent shall determine if the item is merely a request for information, and if so,\nrespond accordingly.\nIf the Board president and Superintendent deny a request from a Board member to place an item on the\nagenda, the Board member may request the Board to take action to determine whether the item shall be\nplaced on the agenda.\nThe Board president and Superintendent shall also decide whether an agenda item is appropriate for\ndiscussion in open or closed session, and whether the item should be an action item subject to Board vote or\nan information item that does not require immediate action.\n\n\nIn order to promote efficient meetings, the Board may bundle a number of items and act upon them together\nby a single vote through the use of a consent agenda. Consent items shall be items of a routine nature and\nitems for which Board discussion is not anticipated and for which the Superintendent recommends approval.\nWhen any Board member requests the removal of an item from the consent agenda, the item shall be\nremoved and given individual consideration for action as a regular agenda item.\nThe agenda shall provide an opportunity for members of the public to comment on any consent agenda item\nunless such item has been previously considered at an open meeting of a committee comprised exclusively\nof Board members. (Government Code 54954.3)\nAny Board action that involves borrowing $100,000 or more shall be discussed, considered, and deliberated\nupon as a separate item of business on the meeting agenda.

      "content": "Meeting Procedures\nAll Governing Board meetings shall begin on time and shall be guided by an agenda prepared in accordance with Governing\nBoard bylaws and posted and distributed in accordance with the Ralph M. Brown Act (open meeting requirements) and other\napplicable laws.\nThe Governing Board president shall conduct Governing Board meetings in accordance with Governing Board bylaws and\nprocedures that enable the Governing Board to efficiently consider issues and carry out the will of the majority.\nThe Governing Board believes that late night meetings deter public participation, can affect the Governing Board's decision-\nmaking ability, and can be a burden to staff. Regular Governing Board meetings shall be adjourned by 10:30 p.m. unless\nextended to a specific time determined by a majority of the Governing Board. The meeting shall be extended no more than\nonce and, if necessary, may subsequently be adjourned to a later date.\nQuorum and Abstentions\n \nThe Governing Board shall act by majority vote of all of the membership constituting the Governing Board. (Education Code\n35164)\nThe Governing Board believes that when no conflict of interest requires abstention, its members have a duty to vote on\nissues before them. When a member abstains, his/her abstention shall not be counted for purposes of determining whether a\nmajority of the membership of the Governing Board has taken action.\nProvided the Governing Board typically has five members and there are no more than two vacancies on the Governing Board,\nthe vacant position(s) shall not be counted for purposes of determining how many members of the Governing Board\nconstitute a majority. In addition, whenever any provisions of the Education Code require unanimous action of all or a specific\nnumber of the members, the vacant position(s) shall not be counted for purposes of determining the total membership\nconstituting the Governing Board. (Education Code 35165)\nPublic Participation\nMembers of the public are encouraged to attend Governing Board meetings and to address the Governing Board concerning\nany item on the agenda or within the Governing Board's jurisdiction. So as not to inhibit public participation, persons\nattending Governing Board meetings shall not be requested to sign in, complete a questionnaire, or otherwise provide their\nname or other information as a condition of attending the meeting, except that if the meeting is conducted using remote\npublic participation or with a Governing Board member attending remotely pursuant to Government Code 54953, a member\nof the public desiring to provide comment through the use of a third party internet website or online platform may be\nrequired to register as required by the third party provider.\nIn order to conduct district business in an orderly and efficient manner, the Governing Board requires that public\npresentations to the Governing Board comply with the following procedures:\n1. The Governing Board shall give members of the public an opportunity to address the Governing Board on any\nitem of interest to the public that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Governing Board, either before\nor during the Governing Board's consideration of the item. (Education Code 35145.5, Government Code\n54954.3)\n \n2. At a time so designated on the agenda at a regular meeting, members of the public may bring before the Governing\nBoard matters that are not listed on the agenda. The Governing Board shall take no action or discussion on any item\nnot appearing on the posted agenda, except as authorized by law. (Education Code 35145.5, Government Code\n54954.2)\n \n3. Without taking action, Governing Board members or district staff members may briefly respond to statements made or\nquestions posed by the public about items not appearing on the agenda. Additionally, on their own initiative or in\nresponse to questions posed by the public, a Governing Board or staff member may ask a question for clarification,\nmake a brief announcement, or make a brief report on their own activities. (Government Code 54954.2)\n\n\n Furthermore, the Governing Board or a Governing Board member may provide a reference to staff or other resources\nfor factual information, ask staff to report back to the Governing Board at a subsequent meeting concerning any\nmatter, or take action directing staff to place a matter of business on a future agenda. (Government Code 54954.2)\n \n4. The Governing Board need not allow the public to speak on any item that has already been considered by a committee\ncomposed exclusively of Governing Board members at a public meeting where the public had the opportunity to\naddress the committee on that item. However, if the Governing Board determines that the item has been substantially\nchanged since the committee heard the item, the Governing Board shall provide an opportunity for the public to\nspeak. (Government Code 54954.3)\n \n5. A person wishing to be heard by the Governing Board shall first be recognized by the president and shall then proceed\nto comment as briefly as the subject permits.\nThe president may also ask a member of the public with the same viewpoint to select a few individuals to address the\nGoverning Board on behalf of that viewpoint. The president may take a poll of speakers for or against a particular issue\nand may ask that additional persons speak only if they have something new to add. Individual speakers shall be allowed\nup to three minutes to address the Governing Board on each agenda or non-agenda item. Should 1-10 people wish to\naddress any topic, the Governing Board may elect to allot three minutes per speaker. Should 11-20 people wish to\naddress any topic, the Governing Board may elect to allot two minutes per speaker. Should more than 20 people wish\nto address any topic, the Governing Board may elect to allot one minutes per speaker. With Governing Board consent,\nthe president may increase or decrease the time allowed for public presentation, depending on the topic and the\nnumber of persons wishing to be heard.\nIn order to ensure that non-English speakers receive the same opportunity to directly address the Governing Board,\nany member of the public who utilizes a translator shall be provided at least twice the allotted time to address the\nGoverning Board, unless simultaneous translation equipment is used to allow the Governing Board to hear the\ntranslated public testimony simultaneously. (Government Code 54954.3)\n \n6. The Governing Board president may rule on the appropriateness of a topic, subject to the following conditions: \nIf the topic would be more suitably addressed at a later time, the president may indicate the time and place when it\nshould be presented.\nThe Governing Board shall not prohibit public criticism of its policies, procedures, programs, services, acts, or\nomissions. (Government Code 54954.3) \nIn addition, the Governing Board shall not prohibit public criticism of district employees. However, whenever a member\nof the public initiates specific complaints or charges against an individual employee, the Governing Board president\nshall inform the complainant of the appropriate complaint procedure. \n \n7. The Governing Board president shall not permit any disturbance or willful interruption actual disruption of Governing\nBoard meetings. Persistent Actual disruption by an individual or group or any conduct or statements that threaten the\nsafety of any person(s) at the meeting shall be grounds for the president to terminate the privilege of addressing the\nGoverning Board and remove the individual from the meeting.\nThe Governing Board president or designee may remove an individual for actually disrupting the meeting. Prior to removal,\nthe individual shall be warned that their behavior is disrupting the meeting and that failure to cease the disruptive\nbehavior may result in removal. If, after being warned, the individual does not promptly cease the disruptive behavior, the\nGoverning Board president, or designee, may then remove the individual from the meeting. (Government Code 54957.95)\nWhen an individual's behavior constitutes the use of force or a true threat of force, the individual shall be removed from a\nGoverning Board meeting without a warning. (Government Code 54957.95)\n \nDisrupting means engaging in behavior during a Governing Board meeting that actually disrupts, disturbs, impedes, or renders\ninfeasible the orderly conduct of the meeting and includes, but is not limited to, a failure to comply with reasonable\nand lawful regulations adopted by a legislative body pursuant to Section 54954.3 or any other law, or engaging in behavior\nthat constitutes use of force or a true threat of force. (Government Code 54957.95)\nTrue threat of force means a threat that has sufficient indicia of intent and seriousness, that a reasonable observer would\nperceive it to be an actual threat to use force by the person making the threat. (Government Code 54957.95)\n\n\nAdditionally, the Governing Board may order the room cleared if necessary. In this case, members of the media not\nparticipating in the disturbance shall be allowed to remain, and individuals not participating in such disturbances may be\nallowed to remain at the discretion of the Governing Board.
