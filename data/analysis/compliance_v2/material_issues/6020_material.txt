Missing Parent Complaint Process for Title I Programs (Confidence: 95%)
Missing from: BOTH
Federal law requires districts to establish a process for parents to submit complaints about the district's Title I parent and family engagement policy or activities. Neither the Board Policy nor Administrative Regulation includes procedures for parents to file complaints or how the district will respond to such complaints.

Legal Basis:
- 20 USC 6318(a)(2)(G): The policy shall provide for the participation of parents and family members (including parents and family members who have limited English proficiency, parents and family members with disabilities, and parents and family members of migratory children), including providing information and school reports required under section 1111 in a format and, to the extent practicable, in a language such parents understand.

Required Language:
The district shall establish procedures for parents and family members to submit complaints regarding the district's Title I parent and family engagement policy or activities. The district will investigate and respond to such complaints in a timely manner and provide parents with information about how to file complaints with the California Department of Education if not satisfied with the district's response.
