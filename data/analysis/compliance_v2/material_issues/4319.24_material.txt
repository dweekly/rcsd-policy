MATERIAL COMPLIANCE ISSUES
BP 4319.24: Maintaining Appropriate Adult-Student Interactions
Last Reviewed: 11/20/2019
================================================================================

Missing Specific Complaint Procedures (Confidence: 90%)
Missing from: BOTH
Education Code 44050 mandates that the policy include specific procedures for receiving and investigating complaints. While the BP mentions reporting to the Superintendent and references "applicable complaint procedures," it does not provide the detailed procedural requirements mandated by law.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 44050(b): The policy shall include procedures for receiving and investigating complaints alleging violations of the policy.

Required Language:
Specific procedures must detail: how complaints are filed, who receives them, investigation timelines, notification requirements, interim protective measures, documentation standards, and appeal processes for complaint outcomes.

Recommended Placement: AR

Missing Training Requirements (Confidence: 85%)
Missing from: BOTH
Education Code 44050 requires training on appropriate adult-student interactions. Neither the BP nor AR (which doesn't exist) addresses mandatory training requirements for employees, volunteers, and contractors on the policy content and appropriate boundaries.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 44050(c): The governing board shall provide training to employees on the policy... at least once every two years.

Required Language:
Policy/regulation must specify: (1) Mandatory training for all employees at least once every two years; (2) Training content requirements; (3) Training for new employees within specified timeframe; (4) Training documentation and record-keeping; (5) Training for volunteers and contractors who interact with students.

Recommended Placement: AR
