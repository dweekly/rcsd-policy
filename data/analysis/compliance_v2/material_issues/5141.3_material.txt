Last Reviewed: 01/13/2010
================================================================================

Missing Oral Health Assessment Requirements (Confidence: 90%)
Missing from: BOTH
Neither the BP nor AR addresses the mandatory oral health assessment requirements for kindergarten and first grade students, despite the BP mentioning "oral health examinations" in general terms. The specific implementation procedures and notification requirements are completely absent.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code 49452.8: Commencing with the 2006-07 school year, a pupil, while in kindergarten or while in first grade if the pupil was not previously enrolled in kindergarten in a public school, shall have an oral health assessment completed by a dental professional... The governing board of a school district shall notify the parent or guardian of each pupil of the oral health assessment requirement.

Required Language:
Students in kindergarten or first grade (if not previously enrolled in kindergarten in a public school) shall have an oral health assessment completed by a dental professional. Parents/guardians shall be notified of this requirement. The assessment may be waived if it creates an undue burden or if the student lacks insurance and is unable to pay for the assessment.

Missing Type 2 Diabetes Information Requirements (Confidence: 80%)
Missing from: BOTH
The policy and regulation fail to address the mandatory requirement to provide Type 2 diabetes information to parents/guardians of students in grades 7-12, which is a specific health-related notification requirement that should be included in health examination policies.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code 49452.7: The governing board of a school district that serves pupils in any of grades 7 to 12, inclusive, shall provide information about type 2 diabetes to the parent or guardian of incoming 7th grade pupils... The information shall include, but not be limited to, all of the following: (a) A description of type 2 diabetes. (b) A description of the risk factors and warning signs associated with type 2 diabetes. (c) A recommendation that pupils displaying or possibly suffering from risk factors or warning signs associated with type 2 diabetes should be screened for type 2 diabetes. (d) A description of treatments and prevention of type 2 diabetes. (e) A description of the different types of diabetes screening tests available.

Required Language:
The district shall provide information about Type 2 diabetes to parents/guardians of incoming 7th grade students. This information shall include a description of Type 2 diabetes, risk factors and warning signs, screening recommendations, treatments and prevention methods, and available screening tests.

Recommended Placement: AR
