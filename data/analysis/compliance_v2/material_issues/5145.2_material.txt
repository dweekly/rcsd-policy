Missing Student Appeal Process for Publication Restrictions (Confidence: 85%)
Missing from: BOTH
Education Code 48907 requires districts to establish a clear appeal process when student expression is restricted in school publications. While the AR mentions students can "seek review" from the Superintendent, it lacks the required formal appeal procedures, timelines, and process details mandated by law.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code 48907(b): "Each governing board shall adopt rules and regulations which shall include reasonable provisions for the time, place, and manner of conducting such activities within its respective jurisdiction."

Required Language:
Students may appeal restrictions on expression through a formal process that includes: (1) written appeal to the Superintendent within 5 school days of restriction, (2) Superintendent review and written response within 10 school days, (3) final appeal to the Board of Education if desired, with decision rendered within 30 days.

Recommended Placement: AR
