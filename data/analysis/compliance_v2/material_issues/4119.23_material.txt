Missing Student Records Confidentiality Requirements (Confidence: 90%)

- Education Code 49076: Prohibits disclosure of student records except as specifically authorized, and requires districts to establish policies protecting student privacy.

Required Language:
Policy must address: (1) Prohibition on unauthorized disclosure of student records and educational information; (2) Reference to FERPA and state student privacy laws; (3) Consequences for violations of student privacy; (4) Requirements for staff training on student records confidentiality.

Recommended Placement: BP

The policy does not specifically address confidentiality requirements for personnel records and employee information, which are subject to specific legal protections and disclosure limitations under California law.

Legal Basis:

Required Language:
Policy should include: (1) Prohibition on unauthorized access to or disclosure of personnel records; (2) Limitations on sharing employee personal information; (3) Requirements for secure handling of personnel files; (4) Disciplinary consequences for violations of personnel records confidentiality.
