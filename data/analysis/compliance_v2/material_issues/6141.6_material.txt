MATERIAL COMPLIANCE ISSUES
BP 6141.6: Multicultural Education
Last Reviewed: 06/23/2010
================================================================================

Missing Specific Protected Group Requirements (Confidence: 90%)
Missing from: BOTH
California Education Code mandates specific inclusion of certain groups in social science instruction. The policy mentions "various cultural, ethnic, racial and social groups" generally but does not specifically reference all legally required groups, particularly LGBTQ+ Americans, persons with disabilities, and other statutorily protected groups.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 51204.5: Instruction in social sciences shall include... the role and contributions of... lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans, persons with disabilities, and members of other ethnic and cultural groups, to the economic, political, and social development of California and the United States of America.

Required Language:
Multicultural education shall specifically include the role and contributions of Native Americans, African Americans, Mexican Americans, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, European Americans, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans, persons with disabilities, and members of other ethnic and cultural groups to the economic, political, and social development of California and the United States.

Missing Fair, Accurate, Inclusive and Respectful (FAIR) Education Act Compliance (Confidence: 80%)
Missing from: BOTH
The policy does not address requirements under the FAIR Education Act regarding instructional materials adoption and the prohibition of discriminatory content. This is particularly important given the 2010 adoption date coincides with the FAIR Act passage.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 51501: When adopting instructional materials for use in the schools, governing boards shall include only instructional materials which, in their determination, accurately portray the cultural and racial diversity of our society, including... the role and contributions of... lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans... and which are free of any content that reflects adversely upon persons because of their race, sex, color, creed, handicap, national origin, or ancestry.

Required Language:
When adopting instructional materials, the district shall ensure materials accurately portray cultural and racial diversity and are free of content that reflects adversely upon persons because of their race, sex, color, creed, handicap, national origin, ancestry, or sexual orientation. Materials shall not contain any matter reflecting adversely upon persons on the basis of these protected characteristics.
