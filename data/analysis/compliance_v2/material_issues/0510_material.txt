================================================================================

Missing Language Accessibility Requirements (Confidence: 90%)

Neither the policy nor regulation addresses requirements for providing SARCs in languages other than English for communities with significant non-English speaking populations, which is required under federal and state accessibility laws.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 35256(d): School districts must ensure meaningful access to school information for parents with limited English proficiency, which includes translation of SARCs when required by federal civil rights laws.

Required Language:
The district shall provide SARCs in languages other than English when required by federal civil rights laws, including when the district serves a significant number of parents who speak a language other than English. Translation requirements shall be determined based on district demographics and federal guidance.

Missing Specific Content Requirements (Confidence: 85%)
Missing from: BOTH
The policy references using the state template but does not specify the mandatory content elements required by Education Code, creating risk of non-compliance with specific reporting requirements.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 35256(b): Specifies mandatory content including student achievement data, school conditions, teacher qualifications, curriculum information, and other required elements that must be included in every SARC.

Required Language:
Each SARC shall include all content required by Education Code Section 35256, including but not limited to: student achievement data by grade and subject; school safety and climate information; teacher and staff qualification data; curriculum and instructional materials information; school facilities conditions; and other elements specified in current state requirements.
