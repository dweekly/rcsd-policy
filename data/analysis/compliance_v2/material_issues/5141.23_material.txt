MATERIAL COMPLIANCE ISSUES
BP 5141.23: Asthma Management
Last Reviewed: 01/13/2010
================================================================================

Missing Self-Administration Authorization Requirements (Confidence: 85%)
Missing from: BOTH
While the AR mentions that students may self-administer inhaled asthma medication with proper authorization, it lacks the specific statutory requirements for self-administration authorization, including the mandatory elements that must be included in physician and parent statements, and the district's authority to revoke self-administration privileges.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 49423.1: Requires specific elements in physician and parent statements for self-administration of inhaled asthma medication, including confirmation that the pupil is able to self-administer the medication, that the medication is necessary during school hours, and procedures for emergency situations.

Required Language:
The written statement from the physician shall include: (1) confirmation that the student is able to self-administer inhaled asthma medication, (2) that the medication is necessary during school hours or school-sponsored activities, and (3) the name and purpose of the medication, prescribed dosage, and times or circumstances under which it is to be taken. The parent/guardian statement shall acknowledge that the district incurs no liability as a result of any injury arising from the self-administration of medication and that the parent/guardian shall indemnify and hold harmless the district and school personnel against any claims arising out of the self-administration of medication. The district may revoke authorization for self-administration if the student fails to comply with the requirements.

Missing Backup Medication Storage Requirements (Confidence: 90%)
Missing from: BOTH
Neither the policy nor regulation addresses the statutory requirement for backup supplies of inhaled asthma medication to be provided to the school and stored in a location immediately accessible to school personnel.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 49423.1(c): Requires that a backup supply of the student's inhaled asthma medication be provided to the school nurse or other designated school personnel and stored in a location immediately accessible in the event of an asthma emergency.

Required Language:
Parents/guardians of students authorized to self-administer inhaled asthma medication shall provide the school with backup supplies of the medication. The backup medication shall be stored in a location immediately accessible to the school nurse or other designated school personnel for use in the event of an asthma emergency.

Missing Stock Albuterol Authorization (Confidence: 80%)
Missing from: BOTH
The documents do not address the district's authority to maintain and administer stock albuterol inhalers for emergency use, which is permitted under California law and provides important emergency response capabilities.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 49414.3: Authorizes school districts to provide emergency albuterol inhalers to school nurses and trained personnel for use during respiratory distress emergencies, subject to specific requirements including physician authorization and proper training.

Required Language:
The district may maintain stock supplies of albuterol inhalers at school sites for emergency use during respiratory distress. Use of stock albuterol shall be pursuant to written protocols established by a physician and surgeon, and may only be administered by school nurses or other personnel who have received appropriate training. Parents/guardians shall be notified immediately following any administration of stock albuterol.
