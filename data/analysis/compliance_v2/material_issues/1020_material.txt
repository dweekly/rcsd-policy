Missing Mandated Reporter Training Requirements (Confidence: 90%)

Youth services often involve identifying at-risk children. Both policy and regulation lack specific requirements for mandated reporter training for staff involved in youth services coordination, which is required when district personnel interact with community agencies serving children.

Legal Basis:
- Penal Code Section 11165.7: Any person who enters into an employment or volunteer relationship with a mandated reporter employer on or after January 1, 2021, shall sign a statement on a form prescribed by the Department of Justice acknowledging that the person has knowledge of the reporting requirements under this article and will comply with those requirements.

Required Language:
Staff involved in youth services coordination shall receive mandated reporter training and sign acknowledgment forms as required by Penal Code Section 11165.7. Training shall be provided before staff begin coordinating with external agencies serving minors.

Missing Student Privacy and Information Sharing Protocols (Confidence: 80%)
Missing from: BOTH
The policy mentions cooperation with agencies but lacks required protections for student privacy and procedures for sharing student information with external agencies, as required by FERPA and California privacy laws.

Required Language:
Before sharing any student information with community agencies or collaborative partners, the district shall: (1) Obtain written parental consent unless disclosure is specifically authorized by law; (2) Ensure agencies have legitimate educational interest; (3) Require agencies to maintain confidentiality; (4) Document all information sharing through written agreements.
