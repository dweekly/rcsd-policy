The community advisory committee shall be composed of parents of individuals with exceptional needs... The committee shall assist in parent education and in recruiting parents and other volunteers who may contribute to the implementation of the plan.

Required Language:
The district shall participate in establishing and maintaining a Community Advisory Committee (CAC) as required by Education Code 56190-56194. The CAC shall be composed of a majority of parents of individuals with exceptional needs, and shall advise the SELPA on the development and implementation of coordinated services for individuals with exceptional needs.
