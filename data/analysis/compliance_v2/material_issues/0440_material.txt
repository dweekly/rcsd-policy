MATERIAL COMPLIANCE ISSUES
BP 0440: District Technology Plan
Last Reviewed: 02/15/2017
================================================================================

Missing Accessibility and Assistive Technology Requirements (Confidence: 85%)
Missing from: BOTH
California requires technology plans to address accessibility for students with disabilities and ensure assistive technology is available. Neither the policy nor regulation addresses accessibility compliance, assistive technology provisions, or accommodations for students with disabilities in technology planning.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 56040: Each local plan shall include provisions for assistive technology devices and assistive technology services for individuals with exceptional needs as required by federal law.

Required Language:
The technology plan shall ensure accessibility for all students, including those with disabilities, and shall address the provision of assistive technology devices and services as required by federal and state law. The plan shall include strategies for ensuring technology resources are accessible and comply with applicable accessibility standards.

Missing Digital Citizenship and Acceptable Use Policy Integration (Confidence: 90%)
Missing from: BOTH
While the regulation mentions "Internet safety and appropriate and ethical use," California law requires more comprehensive digital citizenship education and clear integration with acceptable use policies. The current language is insufficient to meet statutory requirements for comprehensive digital citizenship instruction.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 51006: It is the intent of the Legislature that pupils develop the skills and knowledge to use technology appropriately, safely, and effectively, including digital citizenship skills.

Required Language:
The technology plan shall include comprehensive digital citizenship education addressing online safety, digital literacy, ethical use of technology, cyberbullying prevention, and responsible digital participation. The plan shall integrate with the district's acceptable use policy and ensure age-appropriate instruction in digital citizenship skills.
