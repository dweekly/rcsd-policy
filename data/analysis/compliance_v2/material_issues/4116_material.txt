Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 44948.3: A probationary employee may be dismissed during the school year for cause, but only after being given written notice of the charges and an opportunity to be heard.

Required Language:
Before dismissing a probationary employee during the school year for cause, the employee shall be provided with written notice of the specific charges and given an opportunity to respond to those charges before an appropriate administrator.
