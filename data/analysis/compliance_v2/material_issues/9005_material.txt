================================================================================

Missing Conflict of Interest Requirements (Confidence: 85%)
Missing from: BOTH
California law requires school board members to comply with specific conflict of interest provisions under the Political Reform Act. The policy lacks required statements about financial disclosure, disqualification from decisions involving financial interests, and adherence to conflict of interest codes.

Legal Basis:
- Government Code Section 87100: "No public official at any level of state or local government shall make, participate in making or in any way attempt to use his official position to influence a governmental decision in which he knows or has reason to know he has a financial interest."

Required Language:
Board members shall comply with conflict of interest requirements under the Political Reform Act, including filing required financial disclosure statements and disqualifying themselves from decisions in which they have a financial interest as defined by law and the district's conflict of interest code.

Missing Brown Act Compliance Requirements (Confidence: 90%)
Missing from: BOTH
The Ralph M. Brown Act requires specific governance standards for public meetings, including requirements for open meetings, proper notice, and restrictions on serial meetings. These fundamental governance requirements are not addressed in the policy.

Legal Basis:
- Government Code Section 54950 et seq.: "In enacting this chapter, the Legislature finds and declares that the public commissions, boards and councils and the other public agencies in this State exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business. It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly."

Required Language:
Board members shall comply with the Ralph M. Brown Act requirements for open meetings, including proper notice of meetings, conducting business in public session except as authorized for closed session, and avoiding serial meetings or other communications that circumvent public meeting requirements.

Missing Gift and Honoraria Restrictions (Confidence: 80%)
Missing from: BOTH
The Political Reform Act establishes specific limits on gifts and honoraria that public officials may receive. School board governance standards must address these legal restrictions to ensure compliance.

Legal Basis:
- Government Code Section 89503: "No elected officer of a state or local government agency shall accept any honorarium while that person holds office."

Required Language:
Board members shall not accept honoraria and shall comply with gift limitations as established under the Political Reform Act and Fair Political Practices Commission regulations.
