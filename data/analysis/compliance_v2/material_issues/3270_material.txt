Last Reviewed: 11/04/2009
================================================================================

Missing Board Authorization Requirement for Property Disposal (Confidence: 85%)
Missing from: BOTH
Education Code 17545 requires that the Board of Education authorize the disposal of personal property by resolution or motion at a public meeting. While the policy mentions "Board approval," neither document explicitly states that disposal must be authorized by formal Board action (resolution or motion) at a public meeting as required by law.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 17545: "The governing board of any school district may, by resolution or motion adopted at a public meeting, authorize the sale of personal property belonging to the district..."

Required Language:
The Board of Education shall authorize the disposal of district personal property by resolution or motion adopted at a public meeting.

Recommended Placement: BP
