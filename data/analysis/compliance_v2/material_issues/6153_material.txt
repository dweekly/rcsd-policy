Required Language:
Transportation for school-sponsored trips shall comply with all applicable state and federal safety requirements. Drivers must possess appropriate licenses and certifications. All vehicles used must meet safety inspection requirements and carry appropriate insurance coverage.

Neither document establishes required emergency procedures, communication protocols with parents/district during emergencies, or emergency contact requirements that are essential for student safety during trips.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 32020: Each school district shall establish written procedures to ensure the safety of pupils and staff during emergencies, disasters, and threats of violence.

Required Language:
Emergency procedures shall be established for all school-sponsored trips, including communication protocols with the district and parents/guardians, emergency contact information requirements, and procedures for medical emergencies, natural disasters, and other crisis situations.

Missing Chaperone Background Check Requirements (Confidence: 85%)

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 45125.1: A person shall not be employed or serve as a volunteer aide in a position in which he or she would have supervisory or disciplinary power over pupils or would have, or would likely have, access to pupils outside of the direct supervision of a certificated employee, unless a criminal background investigation has been conducted.

Required Language:
All chaperones and volunteers participating in school-sponsored trips must complete required background checks and clearances as mandated by Education Code Section 45125.1 prior to participation in any trip involving student supervision.
