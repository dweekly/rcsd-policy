Missing Required Annual Notification Content (Confidence: 85%)
Missing from: BOTH
Education Code 48980 requires specific notification content to be provided to parents/guardians at the beginning of each school year regarding medication administration options. While the AR mentions providing notification of "options available," it does not specify the comprehensive content required by law, including information about epinephrine auto-injectors and opioid antagonists available at schools.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code 48980(a): At the beginning of the first semester or quarter of the regular school year, the governing board of each school district shall notify the parent or guardian of a minor pupil regarding the availability of emergency epinephrine auto-injectors pursuant to Section 49414 and emergency naloxone hydrochloride or another opioid antagonist pursuant to Section 49414.3.

Required Language:
The annual notification to parents/guardians shall include information about the availability of emergency epinephrine auto-injectors at each school site for emergency medical aid to persons suffering from anaphylactic reactions, and the availability of naloxone hydrochloride or another opioid antagonist for emergency medical aid to persons suffering from opioid overdose.
