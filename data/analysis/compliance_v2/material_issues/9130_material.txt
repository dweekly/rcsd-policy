- Government Code 54952: Defines legislative body composition and requires clear establishment of committee structure and membership

Required Language:
Procedures for appointing committee members, including: selection criteria, terms of service, number of members, and process for filling vacancies. For committees including non-Board members, establish application and selection procedures.
