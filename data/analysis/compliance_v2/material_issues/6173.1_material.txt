BP 6173.1: Education For Foster Youth
Last Reviewed: 06/27/2018
================================================================================

Missing Complaint Process Information for Foster Youth (Confidence: 95%)
Missing from: BOTH
The regulation references that information about educational rights of foster youth "shall be included in the annual uniform complaint procedures notification" but fails to specify what specific information must be provided to foster youth about their complaint rights. The law requires specific information about complaint procedures to be provided directly to foster youth and their educational rights holders.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code 48853.5(f): The educational liaison shall ensure that foster youth and persons holding the right to make educational decisions for foster youth are informed of the complaint process available pursuant to Section 48853 and how to initiate that process.

Required Language:
The district liaison shall ensure that foster youth and persons holding the right to make educational decisions for foster youth are informed of the complaint process available and how to initiate that process. This information shall be provided at the time of enrollment and whenever educational decisions are being made.
