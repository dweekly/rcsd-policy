When the cost of materials, supplies, or equipment exceeds the bid limit specified in the Public Contract Code, the governing board shall purchase by competitive bidding.

Required Language:
The district shall follow competitive bidding procedures as required by Education Code 20111 and Public Contract Code when purchases exceed statutory thresholds. Formal bidding procedures, including advertisement requirements, bid opening procedures, and award criteria shall be established.

Missing Public Contract Code Bid Thresholds (Confidence: 90%)

Required Language:

Missing Conflict of Interest Provisions (Confidence: 80%)
