Missing Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Annual Notification Requirements (Confidence: 95%)
Missing from: BOTH
California law requires school districts to provide annual written notification to parents/guardians about pesticide use and IPM practices. While the policy mentions "least toxic pest management practices" and the regulation references IPM procedures, neither document includes the mandatory annual notification requirements or the process for maintaining notification lists.

Legal Basis:
- Food and Agricultural Code Section 13184: Each school district shall provide written notification to all parents and guardians of pupils enrolled at the school of the integrated pest management policy and of their rights under this article. The notification shall be provided at the beginning of each school year.

Required Language:
The district shall provide annual written notification to parents/guardians of all enrolled students regarding the district's integrated pest management policy and their rights to receive advance notification of pesticide applications. Parents/guardians may request to be notified at least 72 hours before pesticide applications at their child's school.
