BP 5022: Student And Family Privacy Rights
Last Reviewed: 01/22/2020
================================================================================

Missing Student Directory Information Policy and Procedures (Confidence: 85%)
Missing from: BOTH
California law requires districts to establish policies regarding student directory information, including what constitutes directory information, annual notification to parents/guardians, opt-out procedures, and restrictions on disclosure. This is a fundamental student privacy requirement that is completely absent from both documents.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 49073: Each school district shall inform parents and guardians of pupils in attendance and pupils in attendance who are 18 years of age or older annually of their rights regarding directory information... Directory information may be disclosed unless a parent or guardian of a pupil or a pupil who is 18 years of age or older has previously submitted a written request to the school district that any or all directory information relating to that pupil not be disclosed without the prior written consent of a parent or guardian of the pupil or the pupil.

Required Language:
The district shall annually notify parents/guardians and eligible students of their rights regarding directory information. Directory information includes: student's name, address, telephone number, email address, date and place of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, and most recent previous school attended. Parents/guardians and eligible students may opt out of directory information disclosure by submitting written notice to the district.

Missing Student Records Access and Disclosure Provisions (Confidence: 90%)
Missing from: BOTH
Federal FERPA and California law require specific policies regarding access to and disclosure of student education records, including procedures for parent/student access, amendment procedures, and disclosure limitations. These fundamental student privacy protections are not addressed in either document.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 49069: The parent or guardian of a pupil or former pupil, or a pupil who is 18 years of age or older, has the absolute right to access any and all pupil records related to their child or themselves which are maintained by school districts or private schools.

Required Language:
Parents/guardians and eligible students have the right to inspect and review student education records, request amendments to inaccurate records, and receive notice of disclosures. The district shall maintain a record of disclosures and limit access to authorized personnel with legitimate educational interests.

Missing Complaint Procedures for Privacy Rights Violations (Confidence: 80%)
Missing from: BOTH
Federal law requires districts to provide procedures for parents/guardians to file complaints regarding alleged violations of student privacy rights. Neither document establishes these required complaint procedures.

Legal Basis:
- 20 USC 1232h(c)(2)(A): The Secretary shall establish or designate an office to investigate, process, review, and adjudicate violations of the provisions of this section and complaints which may be filed concerning alleged violations of this section.

Required Language:
Parents/guardians may file complaints regarding alleged violations of student privacy rights with the district and with the U.S. Department of Education's Student Privacy Policy Office. The district shall establish procedures for investigating and resolving such complaints.
