- Education Code Section 234.1: It is the policy of the State of California to afford all persons in public schools, regardless of their disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic that is contained in the definition of hate crimes, equal rights and opportunities in the educational institutions of the state.

Required Language:
The district shall establish clear procedures for filing complaints related to equity violations, including timelines for investigation, resolution processes, and appeal rights. All complaints shall be handled in accordance with the district's Uniform Complaint Procedures.

Missing Title IX Coordinator and Civil Rights Compliance Officer Designation (Confidence: 80%)
Missing from: BOTH
Federal law requires districts to designate specific individuals responsible for coordinating compliance with civil rights laws, including Title IX. The policy mentions equity generally but does not designate responsible compliance officers.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 221.61: Each local educational agency shall designate at least one employee to coordinate its efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under Title IX, including any investigation of any complaint filed with the local educational agency alleging its noncompliance with Title IX or alleging any actions which would be prohibited by Title IX.

Required Language:
The district shall designate a Title IX Coordinator and Civil Rights Compliance Officer responsible for coordinating compliance with federal and state civil rights laws, investigating complaints, and ensuring equitable treatment of all students and staff.
