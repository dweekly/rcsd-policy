================================================================================

Missing Specific Legal Authority and Powers Statement (Confidence: 85%)

California Education Code requires school boards to have explicit statements of their legal authority and powers. While the policy mentions general authorization under Ed Code 35160, it lacks comprehensive coverage of the board's specific legal powers and duties as mandated by state law.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 35010: The governing board of a school district shall have the powers and duties prescribed by law and the powers and duties necessary to carry out the purposes for which school districts are established.

Required Language:
The Board shall exercise the powers and perform the duties prescribed by law, including but not limited to those powers and duties set forth in Education Code sections 35010 et seq., and shall have all powers necessary to carry out the purposes for which school districts are established.

It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly.
