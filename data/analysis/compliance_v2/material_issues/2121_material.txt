BP 2121: Superintendent's Contract
Last Reviewed: 11/04/2009
================================================================================

Missing Public Notice Requirements for Contract Ratification (Confidence: 85%)
Missing from: BOTH
California law requires specific public notice procedures when ratifying superintendent contracts. While the policy mentions ratification in open session, it lacks the mandatory notice requirements including posting the agenda item and making contract terms available for public inspection before the meeting.

Legal Basis:
- Government Code 54954.2: The agenda shall be posted at least 72 hours before a regular meeting in a location that is freely accessible to members of the public and on the local agency's internet website, if the local agency has one.

Required Language:
The Board shall provide public notice of contract ratification in accordance with the Brown Act, including posting the agenda at least 72 hours in advance and making contract terms available for public inspection prior to the ratification meeting.

Recommended Placement: BP
