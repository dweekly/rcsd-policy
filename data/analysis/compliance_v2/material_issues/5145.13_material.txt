Last Reviewed: 06/27/2018
================================================================================

Missing Specific Parent/Guardian Notification Requirements (Confidence: 85%)
Missing from: BOTH
Education Code 234.7 requires districts to notify parents/guardians of specific rights including: (1) right to free public education regardless of immigration status, (2) information about safe haven laws, and (3) general information about immigration enforcement. While the BP mentions notification generally, neither document specifies the required content about safe haven laws or provides the comprehensive notification framework required by statute.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code 234.7(f): A school district shall provide parents and guardians with information regarding their children's right to a free public education regardless of immigration status or religious beliefs, information about safe haven laws, and general information about immigration enforcement.

Required Language:
The district shall provide parents/guardians with information regarding: (1) their children's right to a free public education regardless of immigration status or religious beliefs, (2) information about safe haven laws, and (3) general information about immigration enforcement. This notification shall be provided annually and made available in the primary languages spoken by students and parents/guardians in the district.
