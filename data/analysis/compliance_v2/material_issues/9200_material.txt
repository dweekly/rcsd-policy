Required Language:
Board members shall complete at least two hours of ethics training every two years as required by Government Code 53235. Newly elected or appointed board members must complete this training within one year of taking office.

(Political Reform Act): Designated employees and officials must file statements of economic interests (Form 700) and comply with conflict of interest provisions, including disqualification from participating in decisions that could affect their financial interests.

Incomplete Brown Act Compliance Framework (Confidence: 80%)
Missing from: BOTH
While the policy mentions providing Brown Act information to board members, it lacks comprehensive guidance on board member responsibilities under the Brown Act, including prohibitions on serial meetings, closed session confidentiality, and communication restrictions.

Legal Basis:
- Government Code Section 54952.2: Board members are prohibited from using a series of communications to discuss, deliberate, or take action on matters within the board's jurisdiction outside of properly noticed public meetings.

Required Language:
Board members shall not engage in serial meetings or use electronic communications to discuss, deliberate, or take action on matters within the Board's jurisdiction outside of properly noticed public meetings.
