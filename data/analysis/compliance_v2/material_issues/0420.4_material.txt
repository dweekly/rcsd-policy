Missing Charter Renewal Procedures (Confidence: 95%)

A charter school seeking renewal shall submit its petition for renewal no later than 30 days before the expiration of the charter, and the chartering authority shall rule on the renewal petition no later than 30 days before the expiration of the charter.

Required Language:
Charter schools seeking renewal must submit renewal petitions no later than 30 days before charter expiration. The Board shall rule on renewal petitions no later than 30 days before charter expiration. Renewal may be granted for successive five-year terms based on the school's performance and compliance with charter terms.
