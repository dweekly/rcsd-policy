================================================================================

Missing Specific Grade-Level Requirements and Course Offerings (Confidence: 90%)
Missing from: BOTH
Education Code requires specific visual and performing arts instruction at elementary levels and course offerings at secondary levels. Neither the BP nor AR (which doesn't exist) specifies the minimum instructional time, grade-level requirements, or mandatory course offerings required by state law.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 51210(f) and 51220(f): Elementary: Visual and performing arts instruction required as part of course of study. Secondary: Visual and performing arts electives must be offered to meet graduation requirements.

Required Language:
Specific requirements for visual and performing arts instruction at elementary grade levels and mandatory course offerings at secondary levels to meet state graduation requirements, including minimum instructional time allocations.

Recommended Placement: AR

Missing Assessment and Student Achievement Monitoring Procedures (Confidence: 85%)
Missing from: BOTH
While the BP mentions evaluation and reporting to the Board, neither document contains specific procedures for assessing student progress in visual and performing arts or monitoring achievement of state content standards, which is required for standards-based instruction.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 60605: Districts shall assess student progress toward meeting state content standards

Required Language:
Procedures for assessing student achievement in visual and performing arts, including methods for measuring progress toward state content standards, documentation requirements, and reporting protocols.

Recommended Placement: AR
