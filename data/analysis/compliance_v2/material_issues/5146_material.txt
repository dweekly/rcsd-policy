Missing Excused Absence Requirements (Confidence: 90%)

California law requires specific provisions for excused absences due to pregnancy and parental leave, including protection of academic standing. While the AR mentions leave of absence, it lacks the comprehensive excused absence framework required by state law.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code 46010.1: Notwithstanding any other law, absences of a pupil from school shall be excused for the purposes of this section if the absence is due to the pupil's pregnancy, childbirth, recovery from childbirth, or related medical appointments.

Required Language:
Absences due to pregnancy, childbirth, recovery from childbirth, or related medical appointments shall be excused. Students shall not be penalized academically for such excused absences and shall be provided the opportunity to make up missed work and receive full credit.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code 222: A school operated by a school district or county office of education shall provide reasonable accommodations to a lactating pupil on a school campus to express breast milk, breastfeed an infant child, or address other needs related to breastfeeding.

Required Language:
The district shall provide reasonable accommodations to lactating students, including time and appropriate private space for expressing breast milk or breastfeeding. Such accommodations shall be provided in a location other than a restroom that is private, clean, and reasonably accessible.

Missing Complaint Process Information (Confidence: 80%)

Students must be informed of their right to file complaints regarding discrimination or failure to provide required accommodations. This procedural protection is essential for enforcement of rights.

Legal Basis:
- 5 CCR 4610: Each local educational agency shall adopt policies and procedures for the investigation and resolution of complaints alleging discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying based on actual or perceived characteristics.

Required Language:
Students who believe they have been subjected to discrimination or denied required accommodations may file a complaint through the district's uniform complaint procedures. Information about the complaint process is available from the district office.
