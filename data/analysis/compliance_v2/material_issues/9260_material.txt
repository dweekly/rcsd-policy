Missing Employee Legal Protection Provisions (Confidence: 95%)
Missing from: BOTH
The policy references providing legal protection for both Board members and employees under Education Code 35208, but only details liability protection for Board members. Employees are entitled to the same legal protections and liability coverage when acting within the scope of their employment, but these protections are not specified in either document.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 35208: The governing board of any school district may provide for insurance against liability of the district and the members of the governing board and employees of the district for injury to persons or damage to property.

Required Language:
Employees shall receive the same liability protection as Board members when acting within the scope of their employment. No employee shall be liable for harm caused by his/her act or omission when acting within the scope of district responsibilities, subject to the same conditions and exceptions that apply to Board members.
