Incomplete Makeup Work Procedures for Excused Absences (Confidence: 90%)
Missing from: BOTH
While the policy mentions students shall complete makeup work "within a reasonable period of time," it lacks the specific timeframes and procedures required by Education Code. The policy does not specify how many days students have to complete makeup work or the process for obtaining assignments.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 48205(a)(1): "...shall be allowed to complete all assignments and tests missed during the absence that can be reasonably provided and, upon satisfactory completion within a reasonable period of time, shall be given full credit therefor."

Required Language:
Students with excused absences shall have a minimum of [specific number] school days equal to the number of days absent to complete makeup assignments and tests. For absences of one day, students shall have at least two school days to complete makeup work. Teachers must provide makeup assignments within [specific timeframe] of the student's return.

Recommended Placement: AR
