Missing Required Registration Requirements for Visitors (Confidence: 85%)
Missing from: BOTH
California law requires school districts to post registration requirements for visitors and establish procedures for visitor registration. While the AR references "posted registration requirements," neither document establishes what those requirements are or the registration procedures that must be followed.

Legal Basis:
- Penal Code Section 627.2: Every public school shall post at every entrance to the school grounds a notice setting forth visitor registration requirements and the hours during which registration is required.

Required Language:
The district shall post at every entrance to school grounds a notice setting forth visitor registration requirements and the hours during which registration is required. All visitors must register with the main office upon entering school grounds during designated hours, provide identification, and receive authorization before proceeding to other areas of campus.

Recommended Placement: AR
