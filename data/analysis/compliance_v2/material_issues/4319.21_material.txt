Required Language:
Before disciplinary action is taken, employees shall be provided: (1) Written notice of specific allegations; (2) Opportunity to respond to allegations; (3) Right to representation during investigative interviews; (4) Access to evidence supporting allegations; (5) Right to appeal disciplinary decisions through established procedures.
