- Government Code Section 26909: Public agencies must maintain adequate internal controls over cash handling and provide for periodic audits of cash funds.

Required Language:
Petty cash funds shall be subject to periodic unannounced audits by district personnel. Internal controls shall include segregation of duties where feasible, dual authorization for fund establishment, and mandatory reporting of discrepancies. All funds shall be audited at least annually as part of the district's financial audit.

Public fund management requires explicit restrictions on prohibited uses of petty cash to prevent misuse of public funds. The regulation lacks specific prohibitions required under California public finance law.

Required Language:
Petty cash funds shall not be used for: personal expenses, loans to employees, cash advances, alcoholic beverages, gifts or donations, or any expenses that could constitute a conflict of interest or violation of public trust.
