Required Language:
The district shall provide induction programs for teachers holding preliminary teaching credentials as required by Education Code Section 44279.2.

Missing Paraprofessional Development Requirements (Confidence: 80%)

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 45344.5: Instructional paraprofessionals employed in programs supported with federal Title I funds shall meet federal qualification requirements and receive appropriate professional development.

Required Language:
The district shall provide professional development for paraprofessionals, particularly those working in Title I programs, to ensure they meet federal qualification requirements and can effectively support student learning under the supervision of qualified teachers.
