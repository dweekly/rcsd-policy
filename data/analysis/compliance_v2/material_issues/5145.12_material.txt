Missing Locker and Property Search Provisions (Confidence: 90%)

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 49050: No school employee shall conduct a search that involves removing or arranging any or all of the clothing of a pupil to permit a visual inspection of the undergarments, breasts, buttocks, or genitalia of the pupil.

Required Language:
School lockers, desks, and other school property are subject to inspection at any time without notice. Students have no expectation of privacy in school-owned property. Procedures for locker searches and inventory of contents must be established.

All searches must be documented in writing, including: date, time, persons present, reason for search, items found, and disposition of evidence. Records must be maintained according to district retention policies.

Required Language:
Procedures must be established for coordinating with law enforcement, including when police involvement is required, who has authority to conduct searches when officers are present, and protocols for evidence transfer.

Missing Emergency/Exigent Circumstances Provisions (Confidence: 92%)
Missing from: BOTH
The policy does not address searches conducted under emergency circumstances where immediate action is needed to prevent harm, which may have different procedural requirements.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 44807: School employees have authority to take immediate action to protect student safety and welfare.

Required Language:
In emergency situations where immediate danger exists, school officials may conduct searches without following normal procedures. Emergency searches must be documented and reviewed by administration within 24 hours.
