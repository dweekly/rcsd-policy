================================================================================

Missing Student Excusal Rights for Religious Observance (Confidence: 85%)
Missing from: BOTH
California law requires districts to establish policies allowing students to be excused from school to observe religious holidays and participate in religious exercises. Neither the BP nor AR addresses student excusal procedures, criteria, or notification requirements for religious observances.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 46014: Students, with the written consent of their parents or guardians, may be excused from school in order to participate in religious exercises or to receive moral and religious instruction at their respective places of worship or at other suitable place or places away from school property designated by the religious group, church, or denomination.

Required Language:
Students shall be excused from school, with written parental consent, to participate in religious exercises or receive religious instruction. The district shall establish procedures for requesting such excusals, including advance notice requirements and make-up work policies.

Missing Accommodation for Religious Dress and Grooming (Confidence: 90%)
Missing from: BOTH
California law specifically protects students' rights to wear religious dress and maintain religious grooming practices. Neither document addresses how the district will accommodate religious attire, head coverings, or grooming requirements that may conflict with dress codes or safety regulations.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 262.5: A pupil shall have the right to exercise freedom of speech and of the press including, but not limited to, the use of bulletin boards, the distribution of printed materials or petitions, the wearing of buttons, badges, and other insignia, and the right of expression in official publications.

Required Language:
Students shall be permitted to wear religious dress, head coverings, jewelry, and maintain grooming practices required by their religious beliefs, provided such practices do not pose a genuine safety concern. Any restrictions must be the least restrictive means necessary to address specific safety requirements.

Missing Complaint and Grievance Procedures (Confidence: 80%)
Missing from: BOTH
The policy lacks procedures for students and parents to file complaints or grievances when they believe religious rights have been violated. This is essential for enforcement and due process protection of religious freedom rights.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 262.3: The governing board of each school district and each county board of education shall adopt rules and regulations for the administration of the rights established under this article.

Required Language:
Students and parents may file complaints regarding alleged violations of religious freedom rights through the district's uniform complaint procedures. The district shall investigate such complaints promptly and provide appropriate remedies when violations are substantiated.

Recommended Placement: AR
