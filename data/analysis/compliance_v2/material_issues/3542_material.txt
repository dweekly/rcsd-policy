================================================================================

Missing Criminal Background Check Requirements (Confidence: 90%)
Missing from: BOTH
Neither the BP nor AR explicitly addresses the mandatory criminal background check and fingerprinting requirements for school bus drivers. While the AR mentions electronic fingerprinting may be used, it fails to establish this as a mandatory requirement for all drivers.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 45125.1: Each person employed by a school district in a position requiring contact with pupils shall be required to submit two sets of fingerprints to the Department of Justice for the purpose of obtaining criminal history record information regarding such person.

Required Language:
All school bus drivers must submit fingerprints for criminal background checks through the Department of Justice and FBI prior to employment. No person may operate a school bus until clearance is received and they are determined to be suitable for employment involving contact with minors.

Missing Student Discipline and Suspension Procedures (Confidence: 92%)

The documents lack specific procedures for handling student discipline issues on buses, including when and how students may be suspended from bus transportation services.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 35291: The governing board of any school district may exclude from the privilege of riding on school buses any pupil whose conduct while riding on, getting on, or getting off the bus is such as to unreasonably interfere with the operation of the bus or the safety of other passengers.
