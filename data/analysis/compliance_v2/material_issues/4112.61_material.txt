Missing Mandatory Reference Disclosure Requirements (Confidence: 95%)

California Education Code Section 44031 requires school districts to disclose specific information when providing employment references for certificated employees, including whether the employee was terminated or resigned while under investigation for misconduct. The policy and regulation lack procedures for mandatory disclosure of dismissal, resignation during investigation, or suspension without pay related to misconduct involving minors.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 44031: When a school district provides a reference for a certificated employee, the district shall disclose whether the employee was dismissed or resigned after notice of dismissal or while under investigation for misconduct, and whether the employee was suspended without pay for misconduct involving a minor.
