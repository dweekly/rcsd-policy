================================================================================

Missing Specific Complaint Filing Timeline Requirements (Confidence: 85%)
Missing from: BOTH
California Education Code requires districts to specify that discrimination complaints may be filed within one year of the alleged incident or within one year of when the complainant first obtained knowledge of the facts. While the policy states complaints will be investigated regardless of timeline compliance, it must still inform complainants of the statutory timeline requirements.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 262.3: A complaint alleging discrimination...may be filed by any person, public agency, or organization. The complaint shall be filed within one year from the date the alleged discrimination occurred, or the complainant first obtained knowledge of the facts of the alleged discrimination.

Required Language:
Complaints alleging unlawful discrimination may be filed within one year from the date the alleged discrimination occurred, or within one year from the date the complainant first obtained knowledge of the facts of the alleged discrimination. However, in cases involving a continuing course of conduct, the complaint shall be filed within one year from the date of the last act of alleged discrimination.
