Missing Foster Youth and Homeless Student Notification Requirements for Expulsion Proceedings (Confidence: 95%)
Missing from: BOTH
California law requires specific notification procedures for foster youth and homeless students during expulsion proceedings. While the AR mentions these requirements for suspension extensions, neither the BP nor AR adequately addresses the mandatory notifications and participation rights for expulsion hearings.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code 48918.1: If the student is a foster child or youth or a homeless child or youth, the superintendent of the school district or the superintendent's designee shall notify the district liaison for foster youth or homeless students, respectively, who shall have the right to attend any meeting, hearing, or proceeding related to the disciplinary action.

Required Language:
If the student subject to expulsion is a foster youth, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the district liaison for foster youth, who has the right to attend any meeting, hearing, or proceeding related to the expulsion. If the student is a homeless child or youth, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the district liaison for homeless students, who has the right to attend any meeting, hearing, or proceeding related to the expulsion.
