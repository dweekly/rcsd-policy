Missing Grade Change Procedures and Limitations (Confidence: 90%)
Missing from: BOTH
While the Board Policy references that grades can only be changed "as provided by law, Board policy and administrative regulation," neither document specifies the actual procedures for when and how grades may be changed, the timeline for grade changes, or the specific circumstances that would justify a grade change.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code 49066: When grades are given for any course of instruction taught in a school district, the grade given to each pupil shall be the grade determined by the teacher of the course and the determination of the pupil's grade by the teacher, in the absence of clerical or mechanical mistake, fraud, bad faith, or incompetency, shall be final.

Required Language:
Procedures for grade changes shall specify that grades may only be changed in cases of: (1) clerical or mechanical mistake, (2) fraud, (3) bad faith, or (4) incompetency. The procedure for requesting and approving grade changes, including timelines and required documentation, shall be established.

Recommended Placement: AR
