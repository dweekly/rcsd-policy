Missing Commission on Teacher Credentialing Reporting Procedures (Confidence: 85%)

The district shall report to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing within 30 days any change in employment status of a certificated employee that results from allegations of misconduct, including resignation, dismissal, non-reelection, or suspension without pay for more than 10 days. Reports shall include all required documentation and follow CTC reporting procedures.
