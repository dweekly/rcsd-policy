Last Reviewed: 12/11/2024
================================================================================

Missing Interactive Process Requirements Under ADA (Confidence: 90%)
Missing from: BOTH
The policy lacks reference to the required interactive process under the Americans with Disabilities Act and California Fair Employment and Housing Act. When an employee requests modified duty due to a medical condition, the district must engage in an interactive process to determine reasonable accommodations, even for temporary assignments.

Legal Basis:
- Government Code Section 12940(n): It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail to engage in a timely, good faith, interactive process with the employee or applicant to determine effective reasonable accommodations.

Required Language:
The district shall engage in an interactive process with employees requesting temporary modified/light-duty assignments to identify and evaluate potential reasonable accommodations. This process shall include discussing the employee's functional limitations, exploring available accommodations, and considering modifications to existing positions or alternative assignments.
