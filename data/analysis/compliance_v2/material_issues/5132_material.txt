Missing Required Consultation Process for Uniform Policy Adoption (Confidence: 90%)
Missing from: BOTH
Education Code 35183 requires specific consultation procedures before adopting a uniform policy, including involvement of parents, students, and school personnel. The policy mentions Board approval but lacks the mandatory consultation process requirements.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code 35183(a): The governing board of a school district may adopt a policy authorizing a school to require pupils to wear schoolwide uniforms, only if the governing board does both of the following: (1) Holds a public hearing before adopting the policy. (2) After the public hearing, finds and declares that the policy is necessary to improve the learning environment, to enhance pupils' self-esteem, or to promote uniformity of dress.

Required Language:
Before adopting any school uniform policy, the Board shall hold a public hearing and, after the hearing, find and declare that the policy is necessary to improve the learning environment, to enhance pupils' self-esteem, or to promote uniformity of dress. The uniform policy shall be developed in consultation with parents, pupils, and school personnel.
