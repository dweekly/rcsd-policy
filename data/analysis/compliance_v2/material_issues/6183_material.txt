Legal Basis:
- Education Code Section 48206.3: Individual instruction shall be provided to pupils with a temporary disability which makes attendance in the regular day classes or the alternative education program in which the pupil is enrolled impossible or inadvisable.

Required Language:
Parents/guardians requesting home and hospital instruction shall submit a written request along with medical verification from a licensed physician stating that the student's condition makes school attendance impossible or inadvisable and the anticipated duration of the disability.
