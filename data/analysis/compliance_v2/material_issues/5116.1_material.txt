Incomplete Appeals Process Description (Confidence: 80%)
Missing from: BOTH
Education Code 35160.5 and 48980 require notification of the appeals process when attendance changes are denied. While the AR mentions that complaints should follow applicable complaint procedures, neither document establishes a specific appeals process for intradistrict transfer denials.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code 35160.5(b)(4): A description of the procedure for application for alternative attendance areas or programs and the appeals process available, if any, when a change of attendance is denied.

Required Language:
Parents/guardians may appeal a denial of an intradistrict transfer request by submitting a written appeal to the Superintendent or designee within [X] days of receiving the denial notification. The appeal shall include the basis for the appeal and any supporting documentation. The Superintendent or designee shall respond to the appeal within [X] days.
