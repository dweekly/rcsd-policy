Missing Parent Notification Requirements for Comprehensive Sexual Health Education (Confidence: 95%)
Missing from: BOTH
California law requires specific parent notification procedures for comprehensive sexual health education, including advance written notice and the right to inspect instructional materials. While the AR mentions excusal rights, it lacks the mandatory notification requirements.

- Education Code Section 51937: A school district may provide comprehensive sexual health education, consisting of age-appropriate instruction, in any kindergarten to grade 12, inclusive, using instructional materials that are age-appropriate... A pupil may not attend any class in comprehensive sexual health education or HIV prevention education, or participate in any anonymous, voluntary, and confidential test, questionnaire, or survey on pupil health behaviors and risks, unless the school district complies with the notice requirements of Section 51938.

Required Language:
Prior to providing comprehensive sexual health education or HIV prevention education, the district shall provide written notice to parents/guardians at the beginning of the school year or at enrollment, informing them that such instruction will be provided during the school year. The notice shall include information about the right to inspect instructional materials, request notification of the specific dates of instruction, and request that their child be excused from participation.
