Missing School Attendance Review Board (SARB) Establishment Authority (Confidence: 90%)
Missing from: BOTH
California law requires districts to either establish their own SARB or participate in a joint SARB. The policy and regulation reference SARB programs but do not establish the district's authority to create or participate in SARB, which is a fundamental requirement for truancy intervention.

Legal Basis:
- Education Code 48320: The governing board of any school district may establish a school attendance review board or may contract with the county superintendent of schools, the probation department, or other school districts to establish a school attendance review board.

Required Language:
The Board may establish a school attendance review board (SARB) or may contract with the county superintendent of schools, probation department, or other school districts to establish a joint SARB to address chronic absence and truancy issues in accordance with Education Code 48320 et seq.
