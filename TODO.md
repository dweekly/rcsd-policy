# TODO

## Critical - Validation Findings

### Address AI Hallucination Issue
- [x] Discovered 73% hallucination rate in AI compliance findings
- [x] Validated only 6 actual compliance gaps (not 612)
- [ ] Document the 6 verified compliance gaps clearly
- [ ] Create manual review process for remaining findings
- [ ] Consider alternative compliance checking methods (CDE/CSBA checklists)

## Known Issues - High Priority

### Fix Empty Policy Content
- [ ] Policy 4119.11 (Sex Discrimination) contains only disclaimer text
- Critical policy area with no actual content
- Solution: Extract from different source or flag for manual review

### Fix Erroneous Cross-References  
- [ ] Exhibit 5145.6-E references 14 non-existent policies
- [ ] Policy 6177 references outdated Title 5 sections
- [ ] AR 4118 references non-existent Ed Code sections

## Planned Features - Medium Priority

### Summary Statistics Dashboard
- [ ] Generate comprehensive statistics for all 512 extracted policies
- [ ] Create visual dashboard showing compliance status by series
- [ ] Export statistics in multiple formats (CSV, Excel, PDF)

### Policy Change Tracking
- [ ] Compare versions of policies over time
- [ ] Highlight what changed between versions
- [ ] Track when policies were last updated
- [ ] Alert when policies haven't been reviewed in X years

### Enhanced Error Handling
- [ ] Better handling of malformed PDFs
- [ ] Recovery from partial extraction failures
- [ ] Detailed error reporting for debugging

## Future Enhancements - Low Priority

### Visualization Dashboard
- [ ] Interactive web dashboard for policy relationships
- [ ] Network graph showing policy cross-references
- [ ] Compliance status heat map
- [ ] Timeline of policy updates

### Full-Text Search
- [ ] Search across all policies, regulations, and exhibits
- [ ] Advanced search with filters (date, type, series)
- [ ] Search result highlighting
- [ ] Export search results

### Multi-Format Report Generation
- [ ] Generate compliance reports in PDF format
- [ ] Create Excel workbooks with multiple sheets
- [ ] Produce Word documents for easy editing
- [ ] Generate presentation slides for board meetings

### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests for pdf_parser.py
- [ ] Integration tests for compliance checking
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Regression test suite

### Configuration Management
- [ ] Configurable logging levels
- [ ] External configuration files
- [ ] Environment-specific settings
- [ ] User preferences

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Chunk large PDFs for memory efficiency
- [ ] Parallel processing for extraction
- [ ] Caching improvements
- [ ] Database backend for large-scale analysis

### User Experience
- [ ] Progress bars for long-running operations
- [ ] Better command-line interface
- [ ] Web interface option
- [ ] Batch operation scheduling

## Recently Completed - Validation Phase

- [x] Created bulk_edcode_fetcher.py to fetch Ed Code sections
- [x] Fetched 713 California Education Code sections
- [x] Created validate_v2_compliance.py to verify AI findings
- [x] Analyzed 730 citations against actual law
- [x] Documented validation findings in VALIDATION_FINDINGS.md
- [x] Created HALLUCINATION_PATTERNS.md to explain AI errors
- [x] Updated documentation to reflect critical findings

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Consolidate multiple compliance checking scripts into one
- [ ] Standardize code style across all modules
- [ ] Improve documentation for developers
- [ ] Add type hints throughout codebase
- [ ] Implement proper logging framework

## Infrastructure Improvements

- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] Automated testing on commits
- [ ] Cloud deployment options
- [ ] API endpoint development
