# TODO

## Known Issues - High Priority

### Fix Empty Policy Content
- [ ] Policy 4119.11 (Sex Discrimination) contains only disclaimer text
- Critical policy area with no actual content

- [ ] AR 4118 references non-existent Ed Code sections

## Planned Features - Medium Priority

### Summary Statistics Dashboard
- [ ] Generate comprehensive statistics for all 512 extracted policies
- [ ] Create visual dashboard showing compliance status by series
- [ ] Export statistics in multiple formats (CSV, Excel, PDF)

### Policy Change Tracking
- [ ] Compare versions of policies over time
- [ ] Highlight what changed between versions
- [ ] Track when policies were last updated
- [ ] Alert when policies haven't been reviewed in X years

### Enhanced Error Handling
- [ ] Better handling of malformed PDFs
- [ ] Recovery from partial extraction failures
- [ ] Detailed error reporting for debugging

## Future Enhancements - Low Priority
