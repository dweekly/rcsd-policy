# TODO List - RCSD Policy Compliance Analyzer

## Active Tasks

### High Priority
- [ ] Fix Policy 4119.11 (Sex Discrimination) which contains only disclaimer text

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Create summary statistics for all extracted policies
- [ ] Build compliance analysis features
- [ ] Implement policy change tracking (compare versions over time)
- [ ] Add error handling for malformed PDFs

### Low Priority
- [ ] Create visualization dashboard for policy relationships
- [ ] Add full-text search capability across all policies
- [ ] Generate compliance reports in various formats (PDF, Excel, etc.)
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for pdf_parser.py
- [ ] Add logging configuration options (currently hardcoded)
- [ ] Consider chunking very large PDFs for memory efficiency
- [ ] Add progress bars for long-running extractions

## Known Issues

### Empty Policy
- **Issue**: Only 1 policy contains no substantive content - Policy 4119.11 (Sex Discrimination and Sex-Based Harassment)
- **Note**: This policy contains only disclaimer text and legal references, despite being reviewed in 2022
- **Context**: The corresponding AR 4119.11 contains comprehensive procedures, but the policy lacks Board position statements
- **Impact**: High compliance risk for a critical area (Title IX/sex discrimination)

### Cross-Reference Extraction
- **Issue**: Cross-references embedded in policy text aren't always extracted
- **Impact**: Related policies might not be identified for context
- **Workaround**: System uses both explicit cross-references and numbering patterns

### Cross-Reference False Positives
- **Issue**: Cross-reference finder incorrectly identifies legal citations (like "20 U.S.C. ยง 6318") as policy references
- **Example**: Policy 6020 references federal code section 6318, not a policy 6318
- **Fix needed**: Improve regex to distinguish between policy references and legal citations

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for pdf_parser.py
- [ ] Add logging configuration options (currently hardcoded)
- [ ] Consider chunking very large PDFs for memory efficiency
- [ ] Add progress bars for long-running extractions

## Notes and Observations

### PDF Structure Patterns
- Each PDF contains policies from a specific number series (0000, 1000, 2000, etc.)
- TOC typically appears in first 3-10 pages
- Policy boundaries marked by "Status:" lines and reference sections
- Some policies have decimal codes (e.g., 1312.4) and exhibit suffixes (e.g., 1313-E)
- Page numbers ending in "504" etc. can be confused with titles - fixed with improved regex

### Extraction Statistics
- Total documents extracted: 512
  - Bylaws: 28
  - Exhibits: 12
  - Policies: 280
  - Regulations: 192
- Only 1 document contains no actual policy content (Policy 4119.11)

### Cross-Reference Analysis
- 60 documents (12%) contain cross-references
- 106 unique policy codes are referenced
- 33 referenced policies (31%) are missing from corpus
- Exhibit 5145.6-E references many non-existent policies and needs updating

## Session Notes
*Current context and important observations*

- Fixed EMPTY_POLICIES_SUMMARY.md - only 1 policy is truly empty (4119.11), not 15
- Cross-reference analysis revealed 33 missing policies, but some may be false positives from legal citations
- Need to improve cross-reference detection to avoid confusing legal citations with policy references
