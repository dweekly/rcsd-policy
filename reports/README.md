## Important Notes

1. **AI Limitations**: The discovery of 73% hallucination rate means AI-generated compliance findings should never be trusted without verification against actual legal text.

2. **Verified Gaps Only**: Only the 6 gaps listed above have been verified against actual California law. All other "issues" were AI hallucinations.

3. **Currency**: Analysis based on policies downloaded May 30, 2025, and Ed Code sections fetched June 2025.
