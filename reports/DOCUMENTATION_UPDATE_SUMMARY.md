- **73.2% hallucination rate** in AI compliance findings
- Only **6 verified compliance gaps** (not 612 as initially reported)
- New validation scripts and processes
- Warnings about not trusting AI legal analysis without verification

### 3. Documentation Files Updated

#### Core Documentation
- **README.md**: Added validation results section, updated script mapping, critical findings

### 5. Accuracy Improvements
All documentation now accurately reflects:

- Recommendations to use official CDE/CSBA resources instead of AI analysis

## No Changes Needed
These files remain accurate as-is:
