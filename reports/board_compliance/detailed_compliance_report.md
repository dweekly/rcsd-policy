## Conclusion

While the initial analysis suggested extensive compliance issues, verification against actual Education Code text revealed that only 6 material gaps exist where both policy and regulation fail to address legal requirements. These gaps are manageable and can be addressed through targeted policy updates. The district's overall policy framework remains substantially compliant with California law.

The Board is recommended to direct staff to prepare policy revisions addressing these six areas for consideration at the next regular board meeting.
