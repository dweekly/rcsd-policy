Subject: Action Required - Six Policy Updates Needed for Legal Compliance

Dear Board Members,

I'm writing to inform you of six specific policy gaps that need your attention. After reviewing our district policies against California law, we found that six of our policies are missing legally required language. 

Here's what we need to fix:

## 1. Student Discipline Policy (5144)

**What's Missing:** Our policy doesn't list the specific reasons students can be suspended or expelled.

**What the Law Says:** Education Code 48900 states: "A pupil shall not be suspended from school or recommended for expulsion, unless the superintendent or principal determines that the pupil has committed an act as defined pursuant to subdivisions (a) to (r)."

**Suggested Fix:** Add this language to the policy:
"Students may be suspended or expelled only for the following acts:
- Causing physical injury or threatening violence
- Possessing weapons or dangerous objects
- Possessing or using controlled substances
- Committing robbery or extortion
- Causing damage to school or private property
- Committing theft
- Using tobacco products
- Committing obscene acts or habitual profanity
- Possessing drug paraphernalia
- Disrupting school activities
- Receiving stolen property
- Possessing imitation firearms
- Sexual harassment or assault
- Harassment, threats, or intimidation
- Selling prescription drugs
- Hazing
- Bullying, including cyberbullying"

## 2. Parent Notification Policy (5145.6)

**What's Missing:** Our policy doesn't specify what information must be included in annual parent notifications or when they must be sent.

**What the Law Says:** Education Code 48980 requires: "At the beginning of the first semester or quarter of the regular school term, the governing board shall notify the parent or guardian of each pupil regarding rights and responsibilities."

**Suggested Fix:** Add this language:
"The district shall send comprehensive notifications to all parents/guardians at the beginning of each school year (by August 31st) that include:
- Student rights regardless of immigration status
- School attendance options and requirements
- Health and medication policies
- Immunization requirements
- Student discipline procedures
- Testing and assessment information
- School safety plans
- How to access student records
- Anti-discrimination policies"

## 3. Medication Administration Policy (5141.21)

**What's Missing:** Annual notification must include information about emergency medications available at school.

**What the Law Says:** Education Code 48980 requires notification about "emergency epinephrine auto-injectors and emergency naloxone or opioid antagonists."

**Suggested Fix:** Add this language:
"The annual parent notification shall include:
- Information about the school's supply of emergency epinephrine auto-injectors for allergic reactions
- Information about emergency naloxone for opioid overdoses
- Procedures for administering these emergency medications
- Parent rights regarding student medication at school"

## 4. Purchasing/Conflict of Interest Policy (3300)

**What's Missing:** No language about board members having financial interests in contracts.

**What the Law Says:** Government Code 1090 states: "Officers or employees shall not be financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity."

**Suggested Fix:** Add this language:
"No board member or district employee shall have any financial interest in any contract made by the district. This includes:
- Direct or indirect financial benefit
- Employment by a vendor
- Ownership interest in a company doing business with the district
Any potential conflict must be disclosed and the person must abstain from all discussions and votes on the matter."

## 5. School Attendance Boundaries Policy (5116)

**What's Missing:** Timeline for notifying families about attendance boundary changes.

**What the Law Says:** Education Code 48980 requires notification "at the beginning of the first semester or quarter."

**Suggested Fix:** Add this language:
"Parents/guardians shall be notified of the following by August 31st each year:
- Current attendance boundaries
- Any changes to attendance boundaries
- Intradistrict transfer options and deadlines
- School choice options available"

## 6. Immunization Policy (5141.31)

**What's Missing:** Requirement to notify all parents annually about immunization requirements.

**What the Law Says:** Education Code 48980 requires annual notification about health requirements including immunizations.

**Suggested Fix:** Add this language:
"The district shall include in its annual parent notification (sent by August 31st):
- Current immunization requirements for school attendance
- List of required vaccines by grade level
- Information about exemptions (medical only)
- Where to obtain immunizations
- Consequences of non-compliance"

## Next Steps

I recommend we:
1. Direct staff to prepare revised policies with the suggested language
2. Have our legal counsel review the changes
3. Bring the updated policies to the next board meeting for approval
4. Ensure all changes are implemented before the next school year

These changes will bring us into full compliance with California law. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
