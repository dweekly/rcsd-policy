# Ed Code Verification Findings

## Executive Summary

We've successfully built a system to verify Ed Code citations in compliance findings. Testing on BP 1221.4 revealed critical issues with AI-generated compliance recommendations.

## Key Findings

### 1. Incorrect Ed Code Citations

The compliance checker claimed:
- "Education Code Section 15278(b) requires that committee members shall serve terms of two years"

**Reality:**
- Ed Code 15278 covers committee PURPOSE and establishment (60-day requirement)
- Ed Code 15278 contains NO term requirements
- Term requirements are actually in Ed Code 15282: "shall serve for a minimum term of two years without compensation and for no more than three consecutive terms"

### 2. System Components Built

1. **Citation Extractor** (`edcode_citation_verifier.py`)
   - Extracts all Ed Code citations from compliance findings
   - Generates reports showing which policies cite which sections

2. **Ed Code Fetcher** 
   - Caches actual Ed Code text from leginfo.legislature.ca.gov
   - Currently requires manual fetching via WebFetch due to dynamic content

3. **Finding Verifier** (`verify_compliance_findings.py`)
   - Compares compliance claims against actual Ed Code text
   - Flags verified vs. unverified requirements

## Verified Ed Code Sections

### 15278 - Citizens' Oversight Committee Establishment
- Requirement: Establish committee within 60 days of election results
- Committee purpose: oversight of bond expenditures
- NO mention of term lengths

### 15280 - Committee Support and Proceedings  
- District must provide technical/administrative assistance
- Proceedings must be open to public
- Must issue regular reports, at least annually
- Documents must be publicly available on website

### 15282 - Committee Membership
- Minimum 7 members
- Terms: "minimum term of two years" and "no more than three consecutive terms"
- Specific membership categories required
- Prohibitions on who can serve

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Re-review ALL compliance findings that cite specific Ed Code sections
   - Manually verify citations before any board action
   - Add disclaimers to existing compliance reports

2. **System Improvements:**
   - Build comprehensive Ed Code cache with verified content
   - Update compliance checker to use correct Ed Code sections
   - Add citation verification as mandatory step

3. **For BP 1221.4 Specifically:**
   - The AR's language "two (2) or three (3) -year term" IS ambiguous
   - Should be clarified to match Ed Code 15282: "minimum term of two years"
   - Maximum of "three consecutive terms" should be clearly stated

## Technical Implementation

```bash
# Extract citations from compliance findings
python scripts/edcode_citation_verifier.py --version compliance_v2

# Verify specific policy findings
python scripts/verify_compliance_findings.py --policy 1221.4

# Results show which claims can be verified against actual Ed Code
```

## Conclusion

The verification system successfully identified that compliance recommendations were citing incorrect Ed Code sections. This validates the need for systematic verification of all AI-generated legal citations before relying on them for policy updates.
