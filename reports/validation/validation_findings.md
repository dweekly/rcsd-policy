# Ed Code Validation Findings

## Executive Summary

After fetching and analyzing 713 Ed Code sections, validation reveals that the AI compliance checker has been systematically hallucinating legal requirements:

- **73.2%** (534/730) of citations are NOT VERIFIED - claims don't match actual law
- **1.4%** (10/730) are VERIFIED - exact matches
- **14.9%** (109/730) are TOPIC MATCHES - related to the topic but specific requirements may not exist
- **10.0%** (73/730) have NO KEY PHRASES to verify

## Critical Implications

1. **612 "material issues" were identified**, but most are based on incorrect legal interpretations
2. The compliance checker appears to be:
   - Inventing specific requirements that don't exist in the law
   - Misquoting legal text
   - Creating obligations beyond what the law requires

## Examples of Hallucinated Requirements

### Policy 0200 - LCAP Goals
**AI Claim**: "The governing board shall adopt a local control and accountability plan using a template adopted by the state board..."
**Reality**: Ed Code 52060 doesn't contain this exact language

### Policy 1312.3 - Complaint Procedures
**AI Claim**: "Must be completed within 60 days from receipt unless extended by written agreement"
**Reality**: The cited section doesn't specify this timeline

### Policy 0420.4 - Charter Schools
**AI Claim**: "A charter may be renewed for successive five-year terms. Renewal petition must be submitted no later than 30 days before expiration..."
**Reality**: Ed Code 47607 has different requirements

## Verified Requirements (1.4%)

Only 10 citations were fully verified:
- GOV 1090 - Conflict of Interest
- EDC 48980 - Parent/Guardian Annual Notification (multiple policies)
- EDC 48900 - Grounds for Suspension/Expulsion

## Recommendations

1. **Do not rely on the AI compliance findings without verification**
2. Each "material issue" needs manual review against actual law
3. Consider using a different approach:
   - Reference official compliance checklists from CDE/CSBA
   - Cross-reference with actual Ed Code text
   - Consult legal counsel for interpretation

The fundamental issue is that the AI model appears to be generating plausible-sounding legal requirements that don't actually exist in California law.
