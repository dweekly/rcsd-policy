# Compliance V2 Analysis Status

## Current State

### Analysis Complete
- ✅ 355 policy groups analyzed (BP and AR together)
- ✅ 262 policy groups have material issues (missing from BOTH documents)
- ✅ 612 total material compliance issues identified

### Verification Status
- ❌ Only 5 Ed Code sections cached and verified
- ❌ 527 Ed Code citations cannot be verified (not in cache)
- ❌ 242 policy groups have problematic findings needing review

## Key Findings

### 1. Most Cited Ed Code Sections
- Section 35160: General board powers (51 citations)
- Section 44050: Employee-pupil interaction notice (20 citations)
- Section 35160.5: Board authority limits (13 citations)
- Section 35186: Williams Act requirements (12 citations)
- Section 48980: Parent notification requirements (12 citations)

### 2. Known Issues Found
- BP 1221.4: Incorrectly cites Ed Code 15278 for term requirements (should be 15282)
- AR 1221.4: "two (2) or three (3) -year term" IS compliant with Ed Code 15282's minimum requirement

### 3. Verification Challenges
- 426 unique Ed Code sections cited across all findings
- Would need to fetch and verify each section to validate recommendations
- Many findings cite general authority (35160) rather than specific requirements

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Build Ed Code Database
```bash
# Sections are listed in:
data/analysis/edcode_fetch_lists/high_priority_sections.txt
data/analysis/ed_code_sections_to_fetch.txt
```

### 2. Verify High-Risk Findings
Focus on policies with 4-5 material issues first:
- BP 4200 - Classified Personnel (5 issues)
- AR 5111.16 - Residency For Homeless Children (5 issues)
- BP 3300 - Expenditures And Purchases (4 issues)
- BP 3514.1 - Hazardous Substances (4 issues)

### 3. Manual Review Process
For each material finding:
1. Verify the Ed Code section is cited correctly
2. Check if the requirement actually exists in that section
3. Confirm the requirement is truly missing from BOTH BP and AR
4. Validate that it's a legal requirement, not just best practice

## Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK**: Taking board action on unverified compliance findings could lead to:
- Unnecessary policy changes based on hallucinated requirements
- Legal exposure if real requirements are missed while fixing fake ones
- Wasted time and resources on non-existent compliance issues

**RECOMMENDATION**: Do not proceed with any policy updates until Ed Code citations are verified.
