# Cross-Reference Analysis

## Overview

Analysis of cross-references within RCSD policies revealed:
- **512 total documents** were analyzed
- **54 documents** (11%) contain cross-references to other policies
- **95 unique policy codes** are referenced throughout the corpus
- **25 referenced policies** (26%) are missing from the extracted documents

Note: This analysis filters out legal citations (U.S.C., CFR, Ed. Code, etc.) to focus only on actual policy cross-references.

## Key Findings

1. **Exhibit 5145.6-E (Parent/Guardian Notifications)** references the most missing policies (14 out of 25), suggesting it's an older document that needs updating.

2. **Critical missing policies** include:
   - **4119.12** - Referenced by 7 documents, appears to be a lactation/breastfeeding policy
   - **5145.71** - Referenced by sex discrimination policies
   - **6159.1** - Referenced by uniform complaint procedures

3. **Series 6000 (Instruction)** has the most missing cross-references (11), which could indicate:
   - Major reorganization of instructional policies
   - Policies that were retired but still referenced
   - Numbering changes over time

## Verification Samples

The analysis correctly identifies policy cross-references while avoiding legal citations:
- ✓ Policy 0410 referenced by Exhibit 5145.6-E
- ✓ Policy 1312.3 referenced by Policy 0410
- ✗ "20 U.S.C. § 6318" is correctly filtered out as a legal citation, not a policy reference

## Recommendations

1. **Update Exhibit 5145.6-E** - This document references 14 non-existent policies and urgently needs revision

2. **Investigate missing Policy 4119.12** - Referenced by 7 documents, this appears to be an important lactation/breastfeeding policy

3. **Check for renumbering** - Many missing policies may have been renumbered:
   - 5145.71 might have become 5145.7 (which exists)
   - Series may have been reorganized

4. **Review critical gaps**:
   - 6159.1 (referenced by uniform complaints) 
   - 4117.6 (referenced by dismissal procedures)
   - 6112 (referenced by absence procedures)

5. **Consider creating missing policies** where genuine gaps exist in coverage
