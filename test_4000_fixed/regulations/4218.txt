disclosed by the employee when it could be reasonably assumed that the employee would have disclosed the facts to the
district. (Education Code 45113)
Initiation and Notification of Charges
Board Policy Manual
Redwood City School District

The Superintendent or designee shall provide notice to the employee of a recommendation for discipline, which includes the
charges and materials upon which the recommendation is based. The notification shall identify an impartial district official
("Skelly officer") with whom the employee may meet at a specified time and place or to whom the employee may provide a
written response to the recommendation of discipline. After meeting with the employee or considering any response from
the employee, the Skelly officer shall recommend to the Superintendent or designee whether to proceed with the
recommendation for discipline.
The Superintendent or designee shall file any final recommendation for a disciplinary action in writing with the Governing
Board. A copy of the recommendation shall be served upon the employee either personally or by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, at the employee's last known address.
The notice shall, in ordinary and concise language, inform the employee of the specific charge(s) or cause(s) for the
disciplinary action, the specific acts and omissions upon which the action is based, and, if applicable, the district rule or
regulation that the employee has allegedly violated. In addition, the notice shall include the employee's right to a hearing on
those charges, the time within which the hearing may be requested which shall be not less than five days after service of the
notice to the employee, and a card or paper which the employee may sign and file to deny the charges and request a hearing. 
(Education Code 45113, 45116)
Request for Board Hearing
Within the time specified in the notice of the recommendation of disciplinary action, the employee may request a hearing on
the charges by signing and filing the card or paper included with the notice. (Education Code 45113)
Any other written document signed and appropriately filed within the specified time limit by the employee shall constitute a
sufficient notice of the request for a hearing. The request shall be delivered to the office of the Superintendent or designee
during normal work hours of that office. If mailed to the office of the Superintendent or designee, it must be received or
postmarked no later than the time limit specified by the district. In cases where an order of suspension without pay has been
issued in conjunction with a recommendation of dismissal, any request for a hearing on the dismissal shall also constitute a
request to hear the suspension order, and the necessity of the suspension order shall be an issue in the hearing.
Employment Status Pending a Hearing
A classified employee against whom a recommendation of disciplinary action has been issued shall remain on active duty
status pending any hearing on the charges, unless the Superintendent or designee determines that the employee's
continuance in active duty would present an unreasonable risk of harm to students, staff, or property. The Superintendent or
designee may, in writing, order the employee immediately suspended from duty without pay and shall state the reasons that
the suspension is deemed necessary. The suspension order shall be served upon the employee either personally or by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, immediately after issuance.
Compulsory Leave of Absence
Upon being informed by law enforcement that a classified employee has been charged with a "mandatory leave of absence
offense," the Superintendent or designee shall immediately place the employee on a leave of absence. A mandatory leave of
absence offense includes:
1. Any sex offense as defined in Education Code 44010
 
2. Violation or attempted violation of Penal Code 187 (prohibiting murder or attempted murder)
 
3. Any offense involving the unlawful sale, use, or exchange to minors of controlled substances as listed in Health and
Safety Code 11054, 11055, and 11056
The Superintendent or designee may place on an immediate compulsory leave of absence a classified employee who is
charged with an "optional leave of absence offense," defined as a controlled substance offense specified in Education Code
44011 and Health and Safety Code 11357-11361, 11363, 11364, and 11370.1 except as it relates to marijuana, mescaline,
peyote, or tetrahydrocannabinols.
An employee's compulsory leave for a mandatory or optional leave of absence offense may extend for not more than 10 days
after the entry of judgment in the criminal proceedings. However, the compulsory leave may be extended if the Board gives
notice, within 10 days after the entry of judgment in the proceedings, that the employee will be dismissed within 30 days
from the date of service of the notice unless the employee demands a hearing on the dismissal.
