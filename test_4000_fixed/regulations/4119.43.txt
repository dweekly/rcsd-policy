Definitions
Universal precautions are an approach to infection control. All human blood and certain human body fluids, including
but not limited to semen, vaginal secretions and any body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood, are treated as
if known to be infectious for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV)
and other bloodborne pathogens. (8 CCR 5193(b))
Personal protective equipment includes specialized clothing or equipment worn or used for protection against a
hazard. General work clothes such as uniforms, pants, shirts or blouses not intended to function as protection against
a hazard are not considered to be personal protective equipment. (8 CCR 5193(b))
A sharp is any object that can be reasonably anticipated to penetrate the skin or any other part of the body and to
result in an exposure incident. (8 CCR 5193(b))
Engineered sharps injury protection is a physical attribute built into a needle device or into a non-needle sharp which
effectively reduces the risk of an exposure incident. (8 CCR 5193(b))
Employee Information
The Superintendent or designee shall distribute to employees information provided by the California Department of
Education regarding acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), AIDS-related conditions, and hepatitis B. This
information shall include, but not be limited to, any appropriate methods employees may use to prevent exposure to
AIDS and hepatitis B, including information concerning the availability of a vaccine to prevent contraction of
hepatitis B, and that the cost of this vaccination may be covered by the health plan benefits of the employees.
Information shall be distributed at least annually, or more frequently if there is new information supplied by the
California Department of Education. (Health and Safety Code 120875, 120880)
Infection Control Practices
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that the worksite is effectively maintained in a clean and sanitary
condition, and shall implement an appropriate written schedule for cleaning and decontamination of the worksite. (8
CCR 5193(d))
Where occupational exposure remains after the institution of engineering and work practice controls, the
Superintendent or designee shall provide appropriate personal protective equipment at no cost to the employee.
Such equipment may include gloves, gowns, masks, eye protection, and other devices that do not permit blood or
other potentially infectious materials to pass through or reach the employee's clothes, skin, eyes, mouth or other
mucous membranes under normal conditions of use. The Superintendent or designee shall maintain, repair, make
accessible and require employees to use and properly handle protective equipment. (8 CCR 5193(d))
The Superintendent or designee shall provide handwashing facilities which are readily accessible to employees.
When provision of handwashing facilities is not feasible, the Superintendent or designee shall provide an appropriate
antiseptic hand cleanser in conjunction with clean cloth or paper towels, or antiseptic towelettes. (8 CCR 5193(d))
For the prevention of infectious disease, employees shall routinely: (8 CCR 5193(d))
1. Perform all procedures involving blood or other potentially infectious materials in such a manner as to
minimize splashing, spraying, spattering, and generating droplets of these substances.
 
2. Use personal protective equipment as appropriate.
 
a. Appropriate clothing, including but not limited to, gowns, aprons, lab coats, clinic jackets or similar outer
garments, shall be worn in occupational exposure situations.
If a garment becomes penetrated by blood or other potentially infectious materials, the employee shall
remove the garment immediately or as soon as feasible. All personal protective equipment shall be
removed prior to leaving the work area. When removed, it shall be placed in an appropriately designated
area or container for storage, washing, decontamination or disposal.

Policy Reference Disclaimer:
b. Gloves shall be worn when it can be reasonably anticipated that the employee may have hand contact
with blood, other potentially infectious materials, mucous membranes and nonintact skin, and when
handling or touching contaminated items or surfaces.
Disposable gloves shall be replaced as soon as practical when contaminated, or as soon as feasible if
they are torn, punctured, or when their ability to function as a barrier is compromised. They shall not be
washed or decontaminated for reuse. Utility gloves may be decontaminated for reuse if the integrity of
the gloves is not compromised, but must be discarded if they are cracked, peeling, torn, punctured, or
exhibit other signs of deterioration or when their ability to function as a barrier is compromised.
 
c. Masks in combination with eye protection devices or face shields shall be worn whenever splashes,
spray, spatter, or droplets of blood or other potentially infectious materials may be generated and eye,
nose or mouth contamination can be reasonably anticipated.
 
3. Wash hands and other skin surfaces thoroughly with soap and running water:
a. Immediately or as soon as feasible following contact of hands or any other skin or mucous membranes
with blood or other potentially infectious materials
 
b. Immediately after removing gloves or other personal protective equipment
When handwashing facilities are not available, the employee shall use antiseptic hand cleanser in
conjunction with clean cloth or paper towels, or antiseptic towelettes. In such instances, hands shall be
washed with soap and running water as soon as feasible.
 
4. Refrain from eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics or lip balm, or handling contact lenses in work areas
with a reasonable likelihood of occupational exposure.
 
5. Clean and decontaminate all equipment and environmental and work surfaces after contact with blood or
other potentially infectious material, no later than the end of the shift or more frequently as required by state
regulations.
 
6. Rather than using the hands directly, use mechanical means such as a brush and dust pan, tongs or forceps to
clean up broken glassware which may be contaminated.
 
7. Use effective patient-handling techniques and other methods designed to minimize the risk of a sharps injury
in all procedures involving the use of sharps in patient care.
a. Needleless systems shall be used to administer medication or fluids, withdraw body fluids after initial
venous or arterial access is established, and conduct any other procedure involving the potential for an
exposure incident for which a needleless system is available as an alternative to the use of needle
devices. If needleless systems are not used, needles or non-needle sharps with engineered sharps injury
protection shall be used.
 
b. Contaminated needles or other sharps shall not be broken, bent, recapped, removed from devices, or
stored or processed in a manner that requires employees to reach by hand into the containers where
these sharps have been placed.
 
c. Disposable sharps shall not be reused.
 
8. Handle, store, treat and dispose of regulated waste in accordance with Health and Safety Code
117600-118360 and other applicable state and federal regulations.
.
a. Immediately or as soon as possible after use, contaminated sharps shall be placed in containers meeting
the requirements of 8 CCR 5193(d)(3)(D). Containers shall be easily accessible, maintained upright
throughout use where feasible, and replaced as necessary to avoid overfilling.
 
b. Specimens of blood or other potentially infectious material shall be placed in a container which prevents
leakage during collection, handling, processing, storage, transport or shipping.
