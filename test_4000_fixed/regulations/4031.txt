The following procedures shall be used when a district employee or job applicant has a complaint alleging that a
specific action, policy, procedure or practice discriminates against him/her on any basis specified in the district's
nondiscrimination policies.
1. The complaint should be initiated promptly after a complainant knew, or should have known, of the alleged
discrimination.
 
2. All parties involved in allegations of discrimination shall be notified when a complaint is filed, when a complaint
meeting or hearing is scheduled, and when a decision or ruling is made. The parties also shall be notified of
their right to appeal the decision to the next level.
 
3. When a complaint is brought against the individual responsible for the complaint process at any level, the
complainant may address the complaint directly to the next appropriate level.
 
4. Meetings related to a complaint shall be held at times the district determines appropriate to the circumstances.
 
5. For the protection of all the parties involved, complaint proceedings shall be kept confidential as appropriate.
