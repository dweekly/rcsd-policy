Hiring
Substitute personnel may be employed on an on-call, day-to-day basis.
In addition, after September 1 of any school year, the Board of Education may employ substitute personnel for the
remainder of the school year for positions for which no regular employee is available. The district shall first
demonstrate to the Commission on Teacher Credentialing the inability to acquire the services of a qualified regular
employee. (Education Code 44917)
Classification
The Board may classify as substitute certificated personnel a teacher hired to fill a position of regularly employed
person absent from service. (Education Code 44917)
The Board may classify as a temporary employee a teacher who is employed at least one semester and up to one
complete school year. Any person whose service begins in the second semester and before March 15 may be
classified as a temporary employee even if employed for less than a semester. The Board shall determine the number
of persons who shall be so employed based on the absence of regular employees due to leaves or long-term illness.
(Education Code 44920)
The Board also shall classify as temporary employees those certificated persons, other than substitute employees,
who are employed to:
1. Serve from day-to-day during the first three months of any term to teach temporary classes which shall not
exist after that time, or perform any other duties which do not last longer than the first three months of any
term (Education Code 44919)
 
2. Teach in special day or in schools of migratory population for not more than four months of any school term
(Education Code 44919)
 
3. Serve in a limited assignment supervising student athletic activities provided such assignments have first been
made available to teachers presently employed in the district (Education Code 44919)
 
4. Serve in a position for a period not to exceed 20 working days in order to prevent the stoppage of district
business during an emergency when persons are not immediately available for probationary classification
(Education Code 44919)
At the time of initial employment and each July thereafter, the Board shall classify substitute and temporary
employees as such. (Education Code 44915, 44916)
Before his/her first day of work, each new substitute and temporary employee shall receive a written statement at
the time of initial employment during each school year confirming his/her employment status and salary. This
statement shall clearly indicate the temporary nature of the employment and the length of time for which the person
is being employed. (Education Code 44916)
Time of initial employment means before the employee starts work. (Kavanaugh v. West Sonoma County Union High
School District)
The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that substitute and temporary employees are appropriately trained,
assigned, oriented and evaluated.
Qualifications
Any person employed on a substitute or temporary basis in a position requiring certification qualifications shall
possess the appropriate credential or permit authorizing his/her employment in such position and shall meet all other
requirements of law for certificated positions.
Any person employed on a substitute or temporary basis in a capacity designated in his/her credential shall also be
required to demonstrate basic skills proficiency in reading, writing and mathematics pursuant to Education Code

Qualifications for Special Education
A noncredentialed person shall not substitute for any special education certificated position. (Education Code 56060)
A person holding a valid credential authorizing substitute teaching may serve as a substitute for a special education
teacher for a period not to exceed 20 cumulative school days for each special education teacher absent during each
school year. Upon application by the district, the Superintendent of Public Instruction may approve an extension of
20 school days. In extraordinary circumstances the district may seek an extension beyond the initial 20 school days.
(Education Code 56061)
In placing substitute teachers in special education classrooms, the district shall give first priority to substitute
teachers with the appropriate special education credential(s), second priority to substitute teachers with any other
special education credential, and third priority to substitute teachers with a regular teaching credential. (Education
Code 56062)
The Superintendent or designee shall recruit and maintain lists of appropriately credentialed substitute teachers.
He/she shall contact institutes of higher education with approved special education programs for possible
recommendations of appropriately credentialed special education personnel. (Education Code 56063)
Salary/Benefits
The Board shall adopt and make public a salary schedule setting the daily or pay period rate(s) for substitute
employees for all categories or classes of certificated employees of the district. (Education Code 44977, 45030)
Granting Probationary Status
Unless released from employment pursuant to Education Code 44954, and with the exception of on-call, day-to-day
substitutes, any substitute or temporary employee who performs the duties normally required of certificated
employees for at least 75 percent of the number of days the regular schools of the district were maintained in that
school year, shall be deemed to have served a complete school year as a probationary employee if employed as a
probationary employee for the following school year. (Education Code 44918)
A temporary employee hired to teach temporary classes or perform other certificated duties not expected to last
more than the first three months of any semester, or to teach special day and evening classes for adults or in schools
for migratory populations for the first four months of a semester, shall be classified as a probationary employee if the
duties continue beyond the time limits. (Education Code 44919)
Release from Employment/Dismissal
The Board may dismiss a substitute employee at any time at its discretion. (Education Code 44953)
The Board may release a temporary employee at its discretion if the employee has served less than 75 percent of the
number of days the regular schools of the district are maintained. After serving during one school year 75 percent of
the number of days the regular schools of the district are maintained, a temporary employee may be released as long
as the employee is notified before the end of the school year of the district's decision not to reelect him/her for the
following school year. (Education Code 44954)
Reemployment Rights
With the exception of on-call, day-to-day substitutes, a temporary or substitute employee who served during one
school year at least 75 percent of the number of days the regular schools of the district were maintained and who
was not released pursuant to Education Code 44954 prior to the end of the school year shall be reemployed for the
following school year to fill any vacant positions in the district. (Education Code 44918)
With the exception of on-call, day-to-day substitutes, a temporary or substitute employee who was released
pursuant to Education Code 44954 but who has nevertheless served for two consecutive years, for at least 75
percent of each year, shall receive first priority if the district fills a vacant position for the subsequent school year at
the grade level at which the employee served during either year. In the case of a departmentalized program, the
employee shall have taught the subject matter in which the vacant position occurs. (Education Code 44918)
