The Board of Education believes that the maintenance of a drug- and alcohol-free workplace is essential to school
and district operations.
No employee shall unlawfully manufacture, distribute, dispense, possess, use or be under the influence of any
alcoholic beverage, drug or controlled substance as defined in 21 USC 81 at any school district workplace. These
prohibitions apply before, during and after school hours. A school district workplace is any place where school
district work is performed, any school-owned or school-approved vehicle used to transport students to and from
school or school activities; any off-school sites when accommodating a school-sponsored or school-approved
activity or function where students are under district jurisdiction; or during any period of time when an employee is
supervising students on behalf of the district or otherwise engaged in district business.
The Superintendent or designee shall notify employees of these prohibitions. (Government Code 8355; 41 USC 702)
An employee shall abide by the terms of this policy and notify the district, within five days, of any criminal drug or
alcohol statute conviction which he/she receives for a violation occurring in the workplace. (41 USC 702)
The Superintendent or designee shall notify the appropriate federal granting or contracting agencies within 10 days
after receiving notification, from an employee or otherwise, of any conviction for a violation occurring in the
workplace. (41 USC 701)
The Board may not employ or retain in employment persons convicted of a controlled substance offense as defined
in Education Code 44011. If any such conviction is reversed and the person acquitted in a new trial or the charges
dismissed, his/her employment is no longer prohibited. A plea or verdict of guilty, a finding of guilt by a court in a trial
without a jury, or a conviction following a plea of nolo contendere shall be deemed to be a conviction. (Education
Code 44836, 45123)
A classified employee may be reemployed after conviction of such an offense if the Board determines, from the
evidence presented, that the person has been rehabilitated for at least five years. (Education Code 45123)
The Board may take appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination, or require the employee to
satisfactorily participate in and complete a drug assistance or rehabilitation program approved by a federal, state or
local health, law enforcement or other appropriate agency.
The Superintendent or designee shall establish a drug- and alcohol-free awareness program to inform employees
about: (Government Code 8355)
1. The dangers of drug and alcohol abuse in the workplace
 
2. The district policy of maintaining drug- and alcohol-free workplaces
 
3. Any available drug and alcohol counseling, rehabilitation, and employee assistance programs
 
4. The penalties that may be imposed on employees for drug and alcohol abuse violations
