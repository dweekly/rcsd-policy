In order to serve the best interests of students and the educational program, the Governing Board authorizes the 
Superintendent or designee to assign certificated personnel to positions for which they are qualified pursuant to their 
certification, preparation, professional experience, and aptitude.
Teachers may be assigned to any school within the district in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement or 
Board policy.
The Board encourages the assignment of experienced and fully credentialed teachers, including those who have attained 
National Board for Professional Teaching Standards certification, to schools with the greatest need to improve student 
achievement.
Assignment to Courses/Classes
 
The Superintendent or designee shall assign teachers based on the grade level and subject matter authorized by their 
credentials.
When there is no credential authorization requirement for teaching an elective course, the Superintendent or designee 
shall select the credentialed teacher whose knowledge and skills best prepare the teacher to provide instruction in that 
subject.
When specifically authorized by law or regulation, the Superintendent or designee may, with the teacher's consent, 
assign a teacher to a position outside the teacher's credential authorization in accordance with the local teaching 
assignment options described in the Commission on Teacher Credentialing's (CTC) Administrator's Assignment 
Manual. Such assignments shall be annually approved by Board resolution. In such cases, the Superintendent or 
designee shall reference in district records the statute or regulation under which the assignment is authorized.
If at any time a certificated employee is required by the district to accept an assignment which the employee believes is 
not legally authorized by the employee's credential, the employee shall notify the Superintendent or designee, in writing, 
of the misassignment. Within 15 working days, the Superintendent or designee shall notify the employee of the legality 
of the assignment. If no action is taken by the district, the employee shall provide written notification to the County 
Superintendent of Schools. No adverse action shall be taken against an employee who files a notice of misassignment. 
 (Education Code 44258.9)
Vacancies and Misassignments
Annually, the district shall review potential misassignments and vacant positions throughout the district. Upon receiving 
notification from CTC of the availability of data regarding potential misassignments and vacant positions in the district, 
the Superintendent shall review the data within 60 days. When necessary, the Superintendent or designee may respond 
by submitting additional documentation to the County Superintendent showing that an employee is legally authorized 
for an assignment and/or that a position identified as vacant was miscoded and a legally authorized employee is 
assigned to the position. (Education Code 44258.9)
If the district subsequently receives, within 90 days of CTC's initial notification, a notification from the County 
Superintendent indicating that a certificated employee in the district is assigned to a position for which the employee has 
no legal authorization, the district shall correct the assignment within 30 calendar days. (Education Code 44258.9)
The district shall serve as the monitoring authority for teacher assignments in any charter school it has authorized, in 
accordance with Education Code 44258.9-44258.10.
Any complaint alleging teacher misassignment or vacancy shall be filed and addressed through the district's procedures

The school accountability report card for each school shall include any assignment of teachers outside their subject 
areas of competence, misassignments, including misassignments of teachers of English learners, and the number of 
vacant teacher positions for the most recent three-year period. (Education Code 33126)
Equitable Distribution of Qualified and Experienced Teachers
The Superintendent or designee shall identify and address the equitable distribution of highly qualified and experienced 
teachers among district schools, including those with higher than average levels of low-income, minority, and/or 
academically underperforming students. The Superintendent or designee shall annually report to the Board comparisons 
of teacher qualifications across district schools, including the number of teachers serving under a provisional internship 
permit, short-term staff permit, intern credential, emergency permit, or credential waiver.
Strategies for ensuring equitable access to experienced teachers may include, but are not limited to, incentives for 
voluntary transfers, provision of professional development, and/or programs to recruit and retain effective teachers.
