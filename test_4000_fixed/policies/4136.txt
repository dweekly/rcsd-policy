================================================================================

The Governing Board recognizes that district employees may receive compensation for outside activities as long as these
activities are not inconsistent, incompatible, in conflict with or inimical to the employee's duties or to the duties, functions or
responsibilities of the district.
Outside paid activities shall be considered inconsistent, incompatible, or inimical to district employment when such activity: 
 1. Requires time periods that interfere with the proper, efficient discharge of the employee's duties
 2. Entails compensation from an outside source for activities which are part of the employee's regular duties
 3. Involves using the district's name, prestige, time, facilities, equipment or supplies for private gain
 4. Involves service which will be wholly or in part subject to the approval or control of another district employee or
Board member
An employee wishing to accept outside employment that may be inconsistent, incompatible, in conflict with, or inimical to the
employee's duties shall file a written request with his/her immediate supervisor describing the nature of the employment and
the time required. The supervisor shall evaluate each request based on the employee's specific duties within the district and
determine whether or not to grant authorization for such employment.
The supervisor shall inform the employee in writing whether or not the outside employment is prohibited. The employee may
appeal a supervisor's denial of authorization to the Superintendent or designee. An employee who continues to pursue a
prohibited activity may be subject to disciplinary action. 
Tutoring
The District may offer school sponsored intervention and enrichment programs at school sites paid out of District funds. If a
certificated employee wishes to tutor a student privately on campus, outside of a school sponsored program, the employee
must complete a facilities use agreement, pay any associated fees, and provide any materials or equipment.
