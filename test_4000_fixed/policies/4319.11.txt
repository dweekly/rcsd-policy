The Governing Board is committed to providing a safe work environment that is free of harassment and intimidation. The
Board prohibits sexual harassment against district employees and retaliatory behavior or action against any person who
complains, testifies, or otherwise participates in the complaint process established for the purpose of this policy.
Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to, harassment that is based on the sex, gender, gender identity, gender
expression, or sexual orientation of the victim and harassment based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.
This policy shall apply to all district employees, interns, volunteers, contractors, job applicants, and other persons with an
employment relationship with the district.
The Superintendent or designee shall take all actions necessary to ensure the prevention, investigation, and correction of
sexual harassment, including but not limited to:
 
1. Providing training to employees in accordance with law and administrative regulation
2. Publicizing and disseminating the district's sexual harassment policy to employees and others to whom the policy
may apply
3. Ensuring prompt, thorough, and fair investigation of complaints
 
4. Taking timely and appropriate corrective/remedial action(s), which may require interim separation of the
complainant and the alleged harasser and subsequent monitoring of developments
The Superintendent or designee shall periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the district's strategies to prevent and address
harassment. Such evaluation may involve conducting regular anonymous employee surveys to assess whether harassment is
occurring or is perceived to be tolerated, partnering with researchers or other agencies with the needed expertise to evaluate
the district's prevention strategies, and using any other effective tool for receiving feedback on systems and/or processes. As
necessary, changes shall be made to the harassment policy, complaint procedures, or training.
All complaints and allegations of sexual harassment shall be kept confidential to the extent necessary to carry out the
investigation or to take other subsequent necessary actions. (2 CCR 11023)
Sexual Harassment Reports and Complaints
Any district employee who feels they have been sexually harassed in the performance of their district responsibilities or who
has knowledge of any incident of sexual harassment by or against another employee shall immediately report the incident to
their direct supervisor, a district administrator, or the district's Title IX Coordinator. Employees may bypass their supervisor in
filing a complaint if the supervisor is the subject of the complaint. A supervisor or administrator who receives a harassment
complaint shall promptly notify the Title IX Coordinator. A supervisor or administrator who receives a harassment complaint
shall promptly notify the Title IX coordinator.
Once notified, the Title IX Coordinator shall ensure the complaint or allegation is addressed through AR
4119.12/4219.12/4319.12 - Title IX Sexual Harassment Complaint Procedures or AR 4030 - Nondiscrimination in
Employment as applicable. Complaints of sexual harassment shall be filed in accordance with the complaint procedure
specified in AR 4030 - Nondiscrimination in Employment. An employee may bypass their supervisor in filing a complaint
where the supervisor is the subject of the complaint. Because a complaint or allegation that is dismissed or denied under the
Title IX complaint procedure may still be subject to consideration under state law, the Title IX Coordinator shall ensure that
any implementation of AR 4119.12/4219.12/4319.12 concurrently meets the requirements of AR 4030.
The Title IX Coordinator shall offer supportive measures to the complainant and respondent, as deemed appropriate under
the circumstances. 
Upon investigation of a sexual harassment complaint, any district employee found to have engaged or participated in sexual
harassment or to have aided, abetted, incited, compelled, or coerced another to commit sexual harassment in violation of this
policy shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, in accordance with law and the applicable collective
bargaining agreement.
