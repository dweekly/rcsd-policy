================================================================================

The Board of Education believes that appropriate dress and grooming by district employees contributes to a
productive learning environment and models positive behavior. During school hours and at school activities,
employees shall maintain professional standards of dress and grooming that demonstrate their high regard for
education, present an image consistent with their job responsibilities and assignment, and not endanger the health or
safety of employees or students. All employees shall be held to the same standards unless their assignment provides
for modified dress as approved by their supervisor.
The district shall allow employees to appear and dress in a manner consistent with their gender identity or gender
expression. (Government Code 12949)
The district shall not discriminate against employees based on hair texture and protective hairstyles, including, but
not limited to, braids, locks, and twists. (Government Code 12926)
In addition, the district shall not dismiss an employee, discriminate against an employee in compensation or in terms,
conditions, or privileges of employment, or refuse to hire a job applicant on the basis of religious dress or grooming
practices. (Government Code 12926, 12940)
This policy shall be presented to employees upon employment, through the employee handbook or other
appropriate means, and may be periodically reviewed with all employees as necessary.
