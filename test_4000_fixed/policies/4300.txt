The Board of Education recognizes that effective management is vital to the success of district students and
programs. Management personnel are expected to demonstrate initiative and good judgment in the development,
implementation, and oversight of district programs. Supervisors shall promote the productivity, professional growth,
and teamwork of district staff.
The Board shall adopt policies related to administrative and supervisory personnel insofar as they are needed to
comply with law and describe terms of employment within the district.
The Board may, by resolution, establish or abolish any or all positions of the senior management of the classified
service. Any employee occupying a senior management position abolished by Board action shall become a member
of the classified or certificated service in a classified or certificated position within the district to which he/she would
otherwise be entitled if he/she had not been in a senior management position. (Education Code 45104.5)
