# Repository Reorganization Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Separated Documentation from Reports
- **`/docs/`** - Now contains only technical documentation about the codebase
- **`/reports/`** - Now contains all analysis outputs, findings, and reports

### 2. Organized Reports by Category
Created subdirectories in `/reports/`:
- **`/board_compliance/`** - Board-ready reports about the 6 verified gaps
- **`/validation/`** - Ed Code validation and hallucination findings
- **`/findings/`** - General analysis summaries
- **`/cross_references/`** - Cross-reference validation results
- **`/policy_analyses/`** - Specific policy analysis examples

### 3. Standardized File Naming
- All report files now use lowercase with underscores
- Consistent naming convention across all directories

### 4. Files Moved (using git mv)

From root directory:
- `VALIDATION_FINDINGS.md` → `reports/validation/validation_findings.md`
- `HALLUCINATION_PATTERNS.md` → `reports/validation/hallucination_patterns.md`

From docs/:
- `CROSS_REFERENCE_ANALYSIS.md` → `reports/cross_references/cross_reference_analysis.md`
- `EMPTY_POLICIES_SUMMARY.md` → `reports/findings/empty_policies_summary.md`
- `PUBLICATION_README.md` → `reports/publication_readme.md`

From data/analysis/:
- `policy_analyses/*.md` → `reports/policy_analyses/`
- `compliance_v2/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` → `reports/findings/compliance_v2_executive_summary.md`
- `COMPLIANCE_V2_STATUS.md` → `reports/findings/compliance_v2_status.md`
- Various verification reports → `reports/validation/`

### 5. Added Navigation
- Created `reports/README.md` with comprehensive guide to all reports
- Created `docs/README.md` explaining technical documentation
- Updated main `README.md` with new structure

## Result
The repository now has a clear separation between:
- Technical documentation for developers (`/docs/`)
- Analysis outputs for stakeholders (`/reports/`)

All files maintain their git history through proper use of `git mv`.
