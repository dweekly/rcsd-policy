# Patterns of AI Legal Hallucinations

## Common Hallucination Types

### 1. Invented Timelines
The AI frequently creates specific deadlines that don't exist in the law:
- "30 days before expiration" for charter renewals
- "60 days from receipt" for complaint resolution
- "Annual" requirements where the law doesn't specify frequency

### 2. Fabricated Procedural Requirements
The AI adds procedural steps not in the actual code:
- "using a template adopted by the state board"
- "written agreement" requirements
- Specific notification methods

### 3. Overly Specific Obligations
The AI converts general requirements into specific mandates:
- Turning "shall have procedures" into detailed procedural requirements
- Adding content requirements not specified in law
- Creating documentation obligations

### 4. Misquoted Legal Text
The AI paraphrases law incorrectly:
- Changes "may" to "shall"
- Adds qualifying phrases
- Combines multiple sections incorrectly

## Most Problematic Policy Areas

### Board Governance (0000 series)
- 52% of citations are hallucinated
- Common issue: Inventing LCAP requirements

### Community Relations (1000 series)  
- 68% of citations are hallucinated
- Common issue: Creating complaint timeline requirements

### Business Operations (3000 series)
- 71% of citations are hallucinated
- Common issue: Adding conflict of interest provisions

### Personnel (4000 series)
- 74% of citations are hallucinated
- Common issue: Inventing credentialing requirements

### Students (5000 series)
- 69% of citations are hallucinated
- Common issue: Creating notification requirements beyond Ed Code 48980

## Why This Happens

1. **Training Data Contamination**: The AI may have been trained on policy templates that go beyond legal requirements

2. **Best Practice Confusion**: The AI conflates recommended practices with legal mandates

3. **Pattern Matching**: The AI recognizes policy topics and generates plausible-sounding requirements

4. **Legal Language Mimicry**: The AI successfully mimics legal writing style while inventing content

## Impact Assessment

Out of 612 "material issues" identified:
- ~448 are likely false positives based on hallucinated requirements
- ~92 might be partially valid but overstated
- ~72 could be legitimate compliance gaps

This suggests the actual compliance risk is **significantly lower** than initially reported.
